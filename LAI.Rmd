2. Gap-filled species-level mean leaf lifespan, with genus-level mean. If genus-level not available, then family-level mean. When neither were available: (1) for deciduous species, used mean lifespan at PNM site, (2) for evergreen species, used a relationship of leaf lifespan (LL) with LMA. This LMA-based relationship was based on data at San-Lorenzo (FTS) for canopy leaves and for species with sufficient sample sizes (n_lifespan > 100) (Figure \@ref(fig:ll-lma)). Per Joe, BCI climate is more similar to San Lorenzo, while PNM site is much drier. More importantly, the BCI 50-ha plot and San Lorenzo support old-growth forests. PNM supports much younger, secondary forest (age unknown, perhaps 100 years). So, used the leaf lifespan-LMA relationship for San Lorenzo. This was used to predict leaf lifespan data for species without leaf lifespan data based on their LMA, after gap-filling species LMA data:
    Gap-filled LMALAM_AVD with the following sequence of priority: 
    LMALAM_AVD relationship with LMADISC_AVD > LMALAM_AVD rel. with LMALEAF_AVD > Genus-level mean LMALAM_AVD (gap-filled with LMADISC_AVD/LMALEAF_AVD) > Family-level mean LMALAM_AVD (gap-filled with LMADISC_AVD/LMALEAF_AVD)

Each observation (circle) is color coded by deciduous class. A linear model fit (line) and equation with R2 and p-value are shown.")}

```

2. BCI-Poachers data goes back to 1985, while BCI-50ha data begins in 2013. I used this entire record. BCI-Poachers has 59 traps of 0.25 m2 each, while BCI-50ha has 62 traps of 0.5 m2 each. Before sending me the leaf-fall dataset, Joe had removed extra traps at BCI-50ha, which were discontinued after a few weeks of observation. I converted observed leaf fall data column in mass units (leaf_gm) to mass per unit ground area as follows:  
    Leaf in gm per m2 ground area at a site = Leaf biomass in gm / (Site-specific trap area in m2 x Total number of traps used ) --- (Eq 1)  
    In Joe's dataframe, column "leaf_gm"" represents leaf biomass in gm.
    Retained only canopy tree species.

3. Distributed weekly leaf_gm_per_m2 over the days of the week with interpolation using base R's approx function.
```r
For a single species, the data-frame looks like this: 
head(df.sp_site[[1]])
       sp4 census leaf_gm n_traps       date         site site.trap.area leaf_gm_per_m2     sp

## First I gap-fill dates in the weekly record data-frame with the following function:

fill.day.gaps <- function(df) {
  df.1 <- df %>% arrange(date) %>%
    # for the first census assume leaf fall is collected over the past week
    mutate(n.days = c(7, as.numeric(date - lag(date))[-1])) %>%
    #  leaf_fall rate per day for the census interval is stored on the day of the census:
    mutate(leaf_gm_rate = leaf_gm_per_m2/n.days,
           # approx() will interpolate this forward until the next census,
           # we want it to interpolate this value backward over the past census interval,
           # so just for computation purposes, leading this value
           leaf_gm_rate_lead = lead(leaf_gm_rate, n = 1))
  # Gap-filling dates
  full.date.df <- data.frame(date = seq(from = min(df$date, na.rm = TRUE),
                                        to = max(df$date, na.rm = TRUE), by = 1)) %>%
    mutate(day_number = as.numeric(difftime(date, min(df$date, na.rm = TRUE) - 1)))
  df.2 <- df.1 %>%
    full_join(full.date.df, by = "date") %>% arrange(date, site)
  return(df.2)
}
# To get leaf fall on each day of the interval
leaf.fall.daygaps <- lapply(df.sp_site, fill.day.gaps)

4. When a species' leaf_gm_per_m2 was recorded at both the sites, obtained an average wieghted by the total trap area to accountfor differential sample sizes

5. Converted leaf_gm_per_m2 to LAI units as   
    leaf_fall_LAI (in m2/m2) = leaf_gm_per_m2 / LMA (in g/m2) --- (Eq 2)  
    LMA units are from Metadata_Lftraits_VariableDefinitionsOnly.doc for data in BCITRAITS_20101220.csv)

6. New: Using Joe's suggestion: Could you estimate living canopy leaf mass per unit ground area present at time t (L[t]) from mean leaf longevity and leaf mass fall per unit ground area at time t (F[t]) as follows:  L[t] = F[t+1] + F[t+2] + â€¦ + F[t + mean leaf longevity]

    1. For each species, calculated a day of the year average of leaf_fall_LAI (m2/m2), weighted by total trap area of sites observed, to account for differential sampling intensity over time. This gives more weight to dates after 2013 when BCI-50ha site observations began. (Figure \@ref(fig:leaf-fall-LAI))) 
    2. LAI, for the changing fraction on the tree is obtained (Figure \@ref(fig:LAI-ssn-loop)) by   
    looping over days t in 1:365   
    LAI[t] <- sum(leaf_fall_LAI[c(t: (t+sp.lifespan)) %% 365])  
    where sp.lifespan are the number of days in species leaf lifespan  
    To normalise LAI, it is the divided by the maximum value.
