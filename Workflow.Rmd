## How is this project set-up

### 1.GLUEsetup_part1_BCI.R

 * Loads best.fit ensembles of Soil Water Potential (SWP) from bci.elm.fates.hydro::psi of a specific version (given by the "current folder")
 * Loads hypothetical rooting profiles generated by R/3.090_root_parameters_b.R
 * Loads Turgor Loss Point (TLP) data
 * Loads tree growth census dates for specific no. of intervals
 * Calculates btran time-series by census-interval for each root profile for all the best.fit SWP ensemble
  + by individual species with species-specific TLP (N of btran time series == No. of species x No. of SWP ensembles x No. of root profiles)
  + at community-mean TLP (No. of btran time series == No. of SWP ensembles x No. of root profiles)
  * Saves all the above info in a list called info, except species level btran is saved in info.2
 
## Then using a combination of a range of hypothetical root profiles obtained from 2.rooting_profiles.R and SWP ensemble simulations generate a btran time-series using equation : Btran= i=1 to i=z RootFrac_z * f(swp_z),
where f(swp_z) is a growth.factor_z based on a linear step relationship with swp_z ap species specific or community mean TLP level.
