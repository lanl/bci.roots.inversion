# Summary

- Deep water access (WA~Deep~) is believed to be an important, drought-tolerance mechanism, but under-studied due to lack of data. Vulnerability to embolism ($\Psi_{88, Stem}$) and safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88, Stem}$) are shown to be predictors of drought-induced mortality risk, but deep water access may delay plants from reaching these critical thresholds. Here we test its role in drought-tolerance strategies of a tropical forest community (Panama) with a novel data-model approach.
- We inversely modelled Effective Rooting Depth (ERD) for 32 large, canopy tree species by linking species growth dynamics (xx trees, 6 censuses, 1990-2015) to VPD, $\Psi_{soil}$ by depth in the whole-soil column, and a novel community-scale model of species vulnerability curves ($K_{Leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{x}$) linking data on the same for 21 species with community-scale softer traits. We evaluated ERD by leveraging existing isotopic tracer data ($\delta^2H$). 
- We find that deeper ERD is associated with higher hydraulic conductivity, greater vulnerability to xylem embolism, narrower safety margin, but lower mean mortality rate. Deeper ERD species spent less time below critical hydraulic thredholds indicating that ERD buffers drought-stress.  
- The role of deep water access in alleviating mortality of drought-sensitive trees have important implications for modeling the future of tropical species and forests under climate change.

# Introduction
\
Intensifying droughts threaten tropical forests, a biome that plays a disproportionately large role in the global carbon and energy cycle, and supports half of the global biodiversity [@Bonan:2008; @Wright:20050th]. Tropical forests are considered an especially drought-vulnerable biome based on current estimates of trees' hydraulic safety margins [@Choat:2012; but see @Oliveira:2019]. Widespread drought-induced mortality has already been observed across the tropics for specific tree groups [@Bennett:2015; @Chitra-Tarak:2018; @Hilker:2014; @Phillips:2010]. However, state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) fail to capture drought-induced vegetation dynamics in the tropics [@Galbraith:2010; @Powell:2013], as underlying mechanisms of drought-tolerance are not fully understood.

\
Among all the mechanisms plants employ to deal with drought, deep water access is arguably the most commonly invoked, but under-studied mechanism. This mechanism assumes that water availability varies belowground by vertical depth and so do rooting depths of co-occuring trees, by species and size. Consequently trees' in the same forest differ in their drought experience, and thus in their responses in term of growth and mortality. A key bottlneck in testing this mechanism community-wide has been lack of data on trees' rooting or water-sourcing depths, followed by data on water-availability at those depths. A recent meta-analysis documented maximum rooting depths for 318 tree species, that is, less than 1% of the World’s 45-53 thousand tree species [@Fan:2017; @Silk:2000]. Further, only a small fraction of those are tropical, even though ~95% of the World’s tree diversity resides in the tropics [@Silk:2000]. Use of stable isotopes of water as a tracer provides an indirect way of trees' water sourcing depths by matching isotopic concentration in plant tissue to it's gradient vertically belowground. Such data is available only for ~0.05% of World's tree species [@Evaristo:2016]. In general, community-scale data collection for rooting or water-sourcing depths is especially challenging for species-rich tropical forests. Further, to estimate plant available water in the vertical soil column requires hydrological data and modeling, but these are rarely co-located with forest inventory sites (but see Johnson, Porporato).


\
Here, we obtained daily dynamics of plant water potential ($\Psi_{soil, z}$) in the whole-soil column of a neo-tropical forest (BCI, Panama) with a locally parametarised and calibrated 1-D hydrological water balance model. We parametarised this model using local soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity by depth and water retention curves, and calibrated it against new data on soil moisture dynamics by depth, as well as catchment evapotranspiration and stream discharge. We then estimated the effective rooting depths for xx large, canopy tree species as the depth ($z$) whose soil water dynamics ($\Psi_{soil, z}$) best explained observed dynamics of species growth (six 5-yearly censuses, 1990-2015) with a novel inverse model. This model incorporated impact of atmospheric drought (VPD) on growth as well as new data on species-specific leaf hydraulic conductivity responses to water stress ($K_{Leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{x}$). As vulnerability curves were collected for a small fraction of species (hard trait), we developed a new model that predicted the parameters of these curves from Leaf Mass Area and Wood Specific Gravity i.e. leveraging soft traits available community-wide. We evaluated the inversely estimated ERD against exisiting data on plant and soil water isotopes ($\delta^2H$).

We test three hypotheses under an overarching one that interspecific variation in effective rooting depths of trees aligns with a conservative-acquisitive trade-off axis.  In this forest (i) dynamics of soil water potential at depth does not cross catastrophic levels even through multi-annual droughts because of high total annual precipitation to evapotranspiration ratio; (ii) canpoy trees with deeper effective rooting depths (ERD) show acquisitive hydraulic architecture: higher maximum stem hydraulic conductance, but greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower hydraulic safety margins; finally, (iii) deeper ERD species have lower mortality rates due to low realised risk of hydraulic failure. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a mechanistic link between trees' realised drought experience, above-ground hydraulic architecture and mortality outcomes for a tropical forest community.

# Materials and Methods
\
In the following sections we describe the study site, the models and data used to estimate and evaluate (1) the soil water potential dynamics by depth over the forests’ rooting zone, (2) species-specific percent loss of leaf conductivity curves (PLC), and (3) species-specific effective rooting depths. These are followed by analyses to address the proposed hypotheses. Note that only new data on leaf physiological traits collected during this study are described below, details of all other datasets employed are described in the Supplementary Information. 

## The Study Site
\
We conducted this study at the seasonally dry tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, given its extensive characterisation in terms of long-term forest demography, plant functional ecology, hydrology, including availability of an independent isotopic tracer study on trees’ water-sourcing depths (Meinzer et al.). The 1,560 hectare Barro Colorado Island was formed after the river Chagres was dammed in 1914 that created Gatun Lake, the main channel of the Panama Canal. Rainfall at BCI is seasonal with a mean annual rainfall of 2687 mm (± 515 SD over 1983-2017) and a four-month long dry season from mid-December through mid-April  (≤ 100 mm rain/month). The entire Island is forested and classified as a tropical moist forest. Although percentage of canopy species that are at least partly deciduous during the dry season is 28%, the maximum percentage of deciduous individuals in the canopy is only 6.3%, and the percentage of crown area that is deciduous is estimated at 9.7% (Condit et al., 2000). Long-term hydrological monitoring at BCI began in 1972, while demographical monitoring began with the 50 ha ForestGEO plot establishment in 1981-82 (Condit, 1998; Hubbell et al., 1999) (Anderson-Texeira xx).

\
In the 50 ha plot all stems above 10 mm are mapped, tagged with a unique number, identified to species level and measured every 5 years through 1985-2015 for diameter growth, mortality as well as recruitment of new stems into the 10 mm size class (Hubbell, S.P., Condit, R., and Foster, R.B., 2010; Condit et al., 2012). This inventory represents 321 woody species across the eight censuses. Aside from a 2 ha patch of ~100 year old secondary forest at the north-eastern corner of the plot the remaining 48 ha represent old growth forest that was never clear cut for agriculture (Piperno 1992). The plot (100 m x 50 m) was originally chosen for its relative uniformity of relief and other physical conditions; the elevation range is only 40 m (120-160 m) (Harms 2001). The plot covers most of the upper catchment of Conrad Creek. The shallow valley of this creek is the main interruption to the otherwise mostly flat or gently sloping plot. The valley gives rise to the 1.5-ha swamp at the end of the wet season. Soils of the plot are homogenous with red light clays, described as the Ava soil type, accounting for 72.4% of the plot (BCI soil survey report). The topsoil field texture is silty clay loam that gradually fines to silty clay in the subsoil. Soil is mostly free draining, but restricted subsoil permeability gives rise to temporary wet season ponding. Detailed descriptions of the climate, geology, flora and fauna of BCI can be found in Croat (1978), Leigh et al. (1982) and Gentry (1990).

## Model ELM-FATES for Soil Matric Potentials

### Model description

\
To estimate dynamics of water availability by depth over the forest’s root zone, we implemented a 1-D hydrological model, the Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model (ELM), coupled with a Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) (hereafter, ELM-FATES). FATES is a state-of-the-art, community-based, open-source model widely used for studying climate-vegetation interactions. FATES is considered a next generation vegetation dynamics model for ELM, with a size-structured group of plants (cohorts) and successional trajectory-based patches using the ecosystem demography approach...... (How ELM talks to FATES)...Detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere (Koven et al., 2020) Fisher et al ).

\
Below we describe the equation of water balance in ELM-FATES that is most relevant for our study site, even though ELM-FATES is capable of incorporating numerous other hydrological processes relevant for wetlands and lakes and snow (CLM4.5 Tech Note). ELM-FATES parameterizes interception, throughfall, canopy drip, infiltration, evaporation, surface runoff, subsurface drainage, redistribution within the soil column, and groundwater discharge and recharge so as to simulate changes in canopy water $\Delta W_{can}$, surface water $\Delta W_{sfc}$, soil water $\Delta W_{liq, z}$, and water in the unconfined aquifer $\Delta W_{a}$ (omitting processes relevant to snow or wetlands and lakes), and can be described as

\begin{equation}
\Delta W_{can} + \Delta W_{sfc} + \sum_{z=1}^{15} \Delta W_{liq,z} + \Delta W_{a} = \left(q_{rain} - E_{v} - E_{g} - q_{over} - q_{h2osfc} - q_{drai}\right)\Delta t
(\#eq:water-balance)
\end{equation}

where, $q_{rain}$ is rainfall, $E_{v}$ is evapotranspiration (ET) of the forest, $E_{g}$ is ground evaporation, $q_{over}$ is surface runoff, $q_{h2osfc}$ is runoff from surface water storage, $q_{drai}$ is sub-surface drainage (all in mm H2O) and $\Delta t$ is the time-step. z are the 15 soil layers exponentially distributed in depth, here, (r soil.depths) (m).

### Model parameterization
\
To parameterise the model, we identified eleven parameters relevant for in Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), determined their ranges based on literature for the study site or for the tropics ([Table 1](#param)), and sampled 10, 000 ensembles from this parameter space with Latin Hypercube Sampling.

\
We ran ELM-FATES for these 10,000 ensembles with hourly climate drivers from 1985-2018 initialised with the stand structure of the 50 ha plot in a single site mode (0.1$^\circ$ x 0.1$^\circ$ centered at 9.1530 $^\circ$N, 280.2539 $^\circ$E). As our key interest here was in soil water availability rather than forest dynamics, we ran ELM-FATES in simplified modes: static stand structure and without plant hydrodynamics, and with a single Plant Functional Type (PFT) of evergreen trees. The latter waws chosen as only 9.7% of BCI crown area is dry-season deciduous and addition of dry-deciduous PFT did not significantly alter results (not shown).

### Model evaluation
\
We calibrated the model against three key fluxes in Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), namely, (i) evapotranspiration ($E_{v} + E_{g}$) from the eddy flux tower, (ii) stream discharge for the Conrad Catchment ($q_{over} + q_{drai}$) and (iii) Volumetric Water Content (VWC) obtained with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) at three depths (10, 40 and 100 cm; relating to $W_{liq, z}$) at point location as well as opportunistic dry season VWC measured over those depths for the entire 50-ha plot (Figure \@ref(fig:hydro-calib). Among the 10,000 parameter ensembles we chose 100 ensembles that best-fit all three fluxes simultaneously (add details...that is those that maximised the sum of regression coefficients between observed and simulated variables.) See [Table 1](#param) for best-fit parameter ranges.

## Model for Leaf Vulnerability Curves at community-scale

We measured ($K_{x, Leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{x, Leaf}$) on adult trees of `r length(unique(data.model.AB[!is.na(data.model.AB$data.A),]$sp))` common species (see SI x). We fitted exponential, sigmoidal, logistic and exponential form of equations to species-level data as prescribed by [@GUYOT:2011] and based on AIC criteria chose exponential form as the best-fitting one (Fig. \@ref(fig:obs-plc-curves)), described as

\begin{equation}
K_{Leaf} = y_0 + Ae^{-B\Psi_{Leaf}} + error
(\#eq:vc-exp)
\end{equation}

where $A$ and $B$ are fitted species-specific parameters.

We fitted parameters $A$ and $B$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) with polynomial equations a functions of two traits that were available at community-scale, namely, $WSG$ and $LMA$, defined as mean wood specific gravity after drying at 100$^\circ$C (g cm^{-3}^) and mean leaf mass per unit area measured for the leaf lamina excluding the petiole and for compound leaves the petiolules (g m^{-2}^) for leaves receiving direct sunlight, respectively. 

\begin{equation}
A = a_3WSG^2 + a_2B + a_1B^2 + a_0 + error
(\#eq:a-mod)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B = b_3WSG^2 + b_2WSG.LMA + b_1LMA^2 + b_0 + error
(\#eq:b-mod)
\end{equation}

where $(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3)$ are coefficients. $WSG$ & parameter $B$ explained large variation in parameter $A$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:a-mod); Adj. R^2^ = `r signif(glance(k_by_psi.models[[2]])$adj.r.squared, 2)`; *P* = `r  signif(glance(k_by_psi.models[[2]])$p.value, 2)`; also see Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-fit)). $WSG$ & $LMA$ explained large variation in parameter $B$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod); Adj. *R*^2^ = `r signif(glance(k_by_psi.models[[1]])$adj.r.squared, 2)`; *P* = `r  signif(glance(k_by_psi.models[[1]])$p.value, 2)`). We thus sequentially used Eq. (\#eq:b-mod) and (\#eq:a-mod) to predict parameters $B$ and $A$, respectively, for the `r length(unique(data.model.AB$sp))` species for which WSG and LMA data were available and fitted vulnerability curves (see Fig. \@ref(fig:comm-plc-curves)).

## ERD Coordination with Above-ground Hydraulic Traits

To evaluate whether ERD was associated with above-ground hydraulic traits (*n* = 8 species with both datasets), we regressed species ERD with maximum stem hydraulic conductance  ($K_{max, Stem}$), leaf Turgor Loss Point ($\Psi_{TLP}$), vulnerability to embolism from cavitation measured in terms of pressure at which 88% of stem hydraulic conductivity is lost ($\Psi_{88, Stem}$), and hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88, Stem}$). 

## Mortality Analyses and Extreme Drought Experience

We calculated mortality rates for large trees (>=10 cm DBH) of xx canopy species for each of the seven census interval ($int$) in the 33 year record (1985-2015; $Mort_{int}$) and a species mean mortality rate across those intervals ($Mort_{mean} = \frac{1}{int}\sum_{int=1}^{6} {Mort_{int}}$). To test whether $ERD$ plays a role in alleviating mortality risk, we regressed species $ERD$ against species ($Mort_{mean}$). To assess whether this may be due to deeper $ERD$ species escaping the experience of catastrophic soil drought, we calculated the proportion of days over the study period (1990-2015) for which soil water potential in the soil zone matching species ERD ($\Psi_{x, ERD}$) were below species $\Psi_{80,Leaf}$.

All statistical analyses were done in R statistical environment (version 3.5.3, @R:2020).

# Results

## Effective Rooting Depths, Vulnerability to Embolism and Hydraulic Safety Margins

\
In this forest modelled Effective Rooting Depths (ERD) for the 32 large, canopy tree species varied from 0.5 m to 13 m (Figure \@ref(fig:sp-erd)). For the subset of species for which hydraulic properties were available, species with deeper ERD showed greater maximum stem hydraulic conductance ($K_{max, Stem}$; *R*^2^ = 0.39, *P* = 0.098, *n* = 8; Figure \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)A), less negative leaf Turgor Loss Point ($\Psi_{TLP}$); *R*^2^ = 0.6, p = 0.024, *n* = 8; Figure \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)B), greater vulnerability to embolism from cavitation with less negative ($\Psi_{88, Stem}$) (*R*^2^ = 0.72, p = 0.007, *n* = 8; Figure \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)C), and narrower hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88, Stem}$; *R*^2^ = 0.74, p = 0.013, *n* = 8; Figure \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)D).

## Effective Rooting Depths, Experienced Drought and Mortality

\
Species with deeper $ERD$ showed lower mean mortality rates across the 33 year record (1982-2015; *R*^2^ = 0.13, *P* = 0.029, *n* = xx; Figure \@ref(fig:erd-mort)). For five out of seven census intervals, species with shallower $ERD$ had significantly higher mortality anomalies ($Mort_{int}$ - $Mort{mean}$ than deeper ERD species; Figure (\@ref(fig:erd-mort-anom)). Analysis of time spent under catastrophic soil drought showed that the proportion of days species $\Psi_{x,~ERD}$ was more negative than species $\Psi_{80, Leaf}$ decreased with species ERD (Figure \@ref(fig:erd-time)). Species with ERD deeper than 1 m did not cross species $\Psi_{80, Leaf}$ at all for the entire 25 year period for which soil water potential $\Psi_{x,~z}$ was modelled (1990-2015).

# Discussion

### ERD not correlated with growth
# Limitations & Future directions: 

- not hydrodynamics, 1D to 3D

- Temperate rooting depths shallow?  Shenk and Jackson

- lightening explains 1/3rd of mortality
- forest is realtively stable over 40 years.

-transient depth of water uptake, which is known to vary seasonally (Ellsworth & Sternberg, 2015), 
In fact, associations between soil water access by roots and aboveground drought survival traits such as resistance of xylem to drought‐induced cavitation (Pockman & Sperry, 2000; Pratt et al ., 2007) or phenology (Jackson et al ., 1995; Hasselquist et al ., 2010), are fairly reliable trade‐off functions in plant eco‐physiology.

- Deep ERD species may possibly be associated with locations of greater water availability rather than having deep rootedness. Future studies should employ a distributed hydrological model to separate these factors.

Future studies: high resolution growth data to better constrain the model. 
  -water storage (capacitance) should be considered
  -shifts in root water-uptake by depth
  -deci

#### Table 1: ELM-FATES parameters chosen for enseble generation, their description, chosen ranges and references and/or rationale.  {#param}

| S.N. | Parameter | Description | Range (Units) | Method of determination with reference
| -- | ------ | ------------- | ------------- |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | fates_leaf_ BB_slope | stomatal slope parameter, as per Ball-Berry | 4 - 16 Unitless  | The range of Ball Berry parameter fitted across several studies as compiled in Table 2 of (Medlyn et al. 2011) | 
| 2 | fates_leaf_ slatop | Specific Leaf Area (SLA) at the top of canopy, projected area basis | 0.0042 - 0.0400 $m^2/gC$ | Based on the observed range of Leaf Mass Area (LMA)--24.97 to 235.8 $g/m^2$-- for individual tree variation across 51 tree species in Barro Colorado Island (this study), and assumption of 50% carbon content in biomass. |  
| 3 | fates_leaf_ vcmax25top | Maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco at 25 $^\circ$C, canopy top | 22.7 - 92.5 umol $CO_2/m^2/s$ | Observed range of Vcmax at 25 $^\circ$C for tropical tree species under relative radiation of 50% or greater, thereby excluding highly shaded leaves. Values derived with a conversion specific for CLM model are used. (Ali et al. 2015) | 
| 4 | fates_roota_ par | CLM rooting distribution parameter | 5.9 - 7.4 per m | Parameter a in Eq. 2 in (Zeng 2001) that regulates the shape of the rooting profile. Range corresponds to this parameter specified for BATS (or IGBP) land cover classified Deciduous Broadleaf Trees (5.9 $m^{-1}$ and Evergreen Broadleaf Trees  (7.4 $m^{-1}$) as given in Table 1 (or 2) of (Zeng 2001). | 
| 5 | fates_rootb_ par | CLM rooting distribution parameter | 0.217 - 1.956 $m^{-1}$ | Parameter b in Eq. 2 in (Zeng 2001) that regulates the depth of the rooting profile. Chosen range of *b* is derived using this equation so as to fit the observed range of rooting depth (d~r~) of 2 - 18 m for Tropical Deciduous Forest (mean ± Standard Error (SE); 3.7 ± 0.5, *n* = 5 trees; min = 2, max = 4.7)  and Tropical Evergreen Forest (mean $\pm$ S.E.; 7.3 $\pm$ 0.5, n = 3 trees and 3 communities; min = 2, max = 18 m) combined (Canadell et al. 1996). Besides the direct observation of roots at 18 m included by (Nepstad et al. 1994) in Paragominas, eastern Amazonia that is included in the above study; in Tapajos, eastern Amazonia water extraction by roots was also inferred up to 18 m. (Davidson et al. Forest Science 2011) |
| 6 | fates_smpsc | Soil water potential at full stomatal closure | 113000 - 242000 mm | Based on observed range of -1.13 to -2.42 MPa for leaf turgor loss point for individual tree variation across 49 BCI tree species. This study| 
| 7 | aveDTB | Distance to bedrock | 3 - 18 m | Ben Turner; pers. comm. | 
| 8 | fmax | The maximum fractional saturated area |  unitless | Empirical | 
| 9 | HKSAT | Soil hydraulic conductivity profile | 0.007 - 0.014 mm/s for $\le$ 12.5 cm; 5.56e-05, 0.0003 for $\ge$ 60 cm | To account for high macroporosity and direct flow paths in tropical soils(Broedel et al. 2017; Tomasella and Hodnett 1996)(Kinner and Stallard 2004; Broedel et al. 2017; Tomasella and Hodnett 1996) For Conrad catchment observed median Ksat (95%CI) for 12.5 cm depth is 38.3 mm/hr (25.4-51.2, *n* = 75), while for 60 cm depth 0.7 (0.2, 1.2, *n* = 40) mm/hr. For reference a storm with 12.5 mm/hr rainfall intensity has a 0.2 probability of occuring in any given rainfall event (Kinner and Stallard 2004). | 
| 10 | HKSAT_ADJ | Adjusting factor for soil hydraulic conductivity | 1 - 8 unitless | To account for high macroporosity and direct flow paths in tropical soils that is not accounted for by small soil core samples (Broedel et al. 2017; Tomasella and Hodnett 1996)(Kinner and Stallard 2004; Broedel et al. 2017; Tomasella and Hodnett 1996) | 
| 11 | fpi_max | Maximum interception fraction of precipitation | 0.05-0.44 unitless | Based on throughfall data from (Zimmermann et al. 2010) and precipitation data for BCI from STRI Physical Monitoring program, defined for precipitation events greater than 10 mm. |
