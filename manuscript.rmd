# Summary

- Among the mechanisms that plants employ to deal with drought, deep water access is arguably the most commonly invoked, but under-studied. Vulnerability to embolism and hydraulic safety margins are shown to be predictors of drought-induced mortality risk, but deep-water access may delay plants from reaching these critical thresholds. Here, we tested the role of deep-water access in survival strategies of a diverse tropical forest community (Panama) using a novel data-model approach. 
- We inversely modeled effective rooting depth (ERD) for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` canopy species by linking growth dynamics (1990-2015) to vapor pressure deficit, water potentials in the whole-soil column, and a species-specific leaf vulnerability curves. We evaluated ERD against existing isotopic tracer data on trees and soil. 
- We find that deeper ERD is associated with higher stem hydraulic conductivity, greater vulnerability to xylem embolism, narrower safety margins, and lower mortality rates over 35 years. Deeper ERD species spent less time below critical hydraulic thresholds indicating that trees mitigate water-stress related mortality risk through deep water access.
- The role of deep-water access in alleviating mortality of drought-sensitive trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of forest dynamics under current and future climate.

# Introduction
\
Tropical forests play a disproportionately large role in the global carbon and energy cycle [@Bonan:2008], and support half of global biodiversity [@Wright:20050th], but face a threat from intensifying droughts [@Doughty:2015; @Xu.2019]. Tropical forests are logically considered to be an especially drought-vulnerable biome given the combination of climate risk and vegetation sensitivity [@Meir:2015trw], yet mortality events in the tropics are rarely as large as those in the temperate and boreal zones (McDowell et al. 2018), leading to questions regarding the role of large trait-diversity in mitigating mortality events. Despite this, widespread drought-induced mortality has already been observed across the tropics for specific tree groups [@Bennett:2015; @Chitra-Tarak.2018; @Hilker:2014; @Phillips:2010] and tropical mortality rates are increasing in some regions [@Brienen.2015; @Hubau.2020]. However, state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) struggle to capture drought-induced vegetation dynamics in the tropics [@Galbraith.2010; @Powell:2013; @Powell.2018], as underlying mechanisms of drought-tolerance are not fully understood or quantified.

\
Among all the mechanisms plants employ to deal with drought, deep water access is arguably the most commonly invoked, but under-studied. This mechanism assumes that water availability varies with soil depth, and that the rooting depths of co-located trees also vary, by species and size [@Meinzer:1999; @Chitra-Tarak.2018; @Brum.2019]. Consequently, trees in the same forest differ in their drought experience, and thus in their growth and mortality responses [@Chitra-Tarak.2018]. A key bottleneck in community-wide testing of this mechanism has been lack of data on trees' rooting or water-sourcing depths, followed by data on water-availability at those depths. A recent meta-analysis documented maximum rooting depths for 318 tree species, that is, less than 0.5% of the world’s more than 60 thousand tree species [@Fan:2017; @Beech:2017]. Further, only a small fraction of those are tropical, even though more than 90% of the world’s tree diversity resides in the tropics [@Slik:2015]. Use of stable isotopes of water as a tracer provides an indirect measure of water sourcing depths by matching the isotopic value in xylem water to variations in soil pore water with depth. However, such data are rare [@Evaristo:2016]. In general, community-scale data collection for rooting or water-sourcing depths is challenging for species-rich tropical forests. 

\
Trade-offs in plant 'traits' shape how plants make a living in their environment (ecological strategies) and also provide the essential constraints to model species-rich communities under a changing environment [@Koven:2020; @Christoffersen:2016kd2d; @Wright:2010; @Bartlett.2019].  Understanding how plant trade-offs lead to alternative life history strategies entails identifying the topography of trait trade-offs in different environments, and how these relate to demographic rates (growth, recruitment and mortality).  Specifically for the water environment (or, resource), observations of individual trade-offs between environment-trait, trait-trait and trait-demography has identified an acquisitive-conservative resource economic spectrum similar to those for light and nutrients, although, for water, examples of all trade-offs observed simultaneously are rare, and below-ground traits or environment linkages are weak [@Reich:2014; @Sterck:2011]. Acquisitive species have traits with high capacity to acquire, move, store and use water (higher hydraulic conductivity, low wood density) and achieve high growth, but build flimsy tissues (high specific leaf area) and are less tolerant of low resource availablity, whereas species with conservative traits are better protected from carbon losses and are more physiologically drought tolerant (greater embolism resistance, larger safety margins). Whether and how the acquisitive-conservative spectrum holds true for the water dynamics vertically below-ground is not clear. Acquisitive species are spatially associated with wet sites (high resource) such as valleys or those with high rainfall [@Kursar:2009; @Oliveira:2019]. Deep rooting may be expected to support an acquisitive strategy by enabling a steady water supply. However, the degree to which deep rooting is associated with an acquisitive strategy may depend on the specific dynamics of water availability by depth at a site, which is affected by precipitation regime and hydrology. For example, in pulse-driven systems *shallow*-rooted plants are associated with acquisitive traits (higher hydraulic conductivity) and opportunistic strategies (e.g. dry deciduousness) that maximise the use of the water-pulse, while *deep*-rooted plants show conservative traits (cavitation-resistant xylem, osmoregulation) [@Schwinning:2013 and references therein]. 

\
Significant efforts have been invested into identifying and linking universal drought indices, above-ground traits, and demographic rates. These efforts have resulted in identification of above-ground traits such as proxies of hydraulic failure as indicators of mortality risk. While correlations between aboveground hydraulic traits and mortality have been identified [@Anderegg:2016], numerous counter examples also exist [@Hoffmann.2011; @Johnson:2018fad; @Nardini:2015; @Paddock:2013]. However, plants' realized water environments, specifically their ability to acquire water via differing rooting depths, are rarely studied, especially in the tropical region. 

\
To better understand how rooting depth is linked to above-ground hydraulic traits and mortality for co-occurring tropical forest tree species, in this paper, we conduct a thorough assessment for a tropical forest of relationships between the water environment in the whole-soil column, above-ground hydraulic traits, estimates of rooting depths and demographic outcomes over 35 years that witnessed droughts of various intensity and duration. Specifically, we test an overarching hypothesis that inter-specific variation in trees' rooting depths aligns species on an acquisitive-conservative economic spectrum, whereby acquisitive trees have rooting depths optimized for more reliable water availability by depth. Our hypotheses are that (i) deep rooted trees have hydraulic traits associated with rapid water transport but cavitation-vulnerable xylem, whereas shallow rooted species are associated with less efficient but safer hydraulic traits (see Table \@ref(tab:hypo)); and that, (ii) deep rooted species have lower mortality rates due to low realized risk of hydraulic failure, whereas shallow rooted species may have higher mortality rates as a result of higher variability in shallow soil water availability. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a mechanistic link between trees' realized drought experience, above-ground hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes for a species-rich forest.

# Materials and Methods
\
In the following sections we describe the study site, the models and data used to estimate and evaluate (1) soil water potential dynamics by depth in the whole-soil column, (2) species-specific leaf vulnerability curves, and (3) species-specific effective rooting depths. These are followed by analyses to address the proposed hypotheses. Descriptions of datasets used and details of some of the methods are described in the Supplementary Information.

\
In summary, we obtained daily dynamics of plant water potential by depth in the whole-soil column with a locally parameterized and calibrated 1-D hydrological water balance model. We developed a novel inverse model to estimate species effective rooting depths (ERD), defined as the depth at which soil water dynamics best explained observed dynamics of species growth. This model incorporated the impact of atmospheric drought on growth and was constrained by above-ground hydraulic traits, namely, species leaf vulnerability curves. For the latter, we collected new data on vulnerability curves for 21 species and scale-up to the community via scaling relationships with 'softer' traits, namely, Wood Density and Leaf Mass Area. We evaluated ERD against independent estimates based on existing data on plant and soil water isotopes. We then tested whether deeper ERD was associated with hydraulically efficient but vulnerable traits (Table 1 ), but not greater mortality rates.

## Study Site Description
\
We conducted this study at the seasonally dry tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, given its extensive characterization in terms of long-term forest demography, plant functional ecology, hydrology, and data on stable water isotopes on tree species and soil from an independent study on trees’ water-sourcing depths [@Meinzer:1999]. The 1,560ha island was formed after the river Chagres was dammed in 1914 to create Gatun Lake and complete the Panama Canal. Rainfall at BCI is seasonal with a mean annual rainfall of `r round(rain.man.stats$rain)` mm ($\pm$ `r round(rain.man.stats$rain.sd)` SD; `r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`) and a four-month long dry season from mid-December through mid-April ($\le$ 100 mm rain month^-1^). The entire island is forested and classified as a tropical moist forest in the Holdridge Life Zone system. Although 28% of canopy tree species are at least partly deciduous during the dry season, this amounts to the maximum percentage of deciduous individuals in the canopy this amounts to is only 6.3%, and the percentage of crown area that is deciduous is estimated at 9.7% [@Condit:2000]. Long-term hydrological monitoring at BCI began in 1972, while demographical monitoring began with the 50 ha ForestGEO plot establishment in 1981-82 [@Condit.1998uq; @Hubbell:1999; @Anderson-Teixeira:2014].

\
In the 50 ha plot all stems above 10 mm diameter at breast height (dbh) are mapped, tagged with a unique number, identified to species and measured every 5 years through 1985-2015 for growth, mortality as well as recruitment of new stems into the 10 mm size class [@Condit.2017]. This inventory represents 321 woody species across the eight censuses. Aside from a 2ha patch of ~100-year-old secondary forest at the north-eastern corner of the plot the remaining 48ha represent old growth forest that was never clear cut for agriculture. The plot (1000 m x 500 m) was originally chosen for its relative uniformity of relief and other physical conditions; the elevation range is only 40 m (120-160 m) [@Harms:2001]. The plot is situated in the Conrad catchment. Soils of the plot are homogeneous with red light clays, described as the Ava soil type, accounting for 72.4% of the plot [@Baillie.2017]. The topsoil field texture is silty clay loam that gradually fines to silty clay in the subsoil. Soil is mostly free draining, but restricted subsoil permeability gives rise to temporary wet season ponding. Detailed descriptions of the climate, geology, flora and fauna of BCI can be found elsewhere [@Croat.1978; @Leigh.1982; @Gentry.1990].

## Model ELM-FATES for Soil Matric Potentials

### Model description
\
To estimate dynamics of water availability by depth over the forest’s rooting zone, we used the Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model (ELM), coupled with the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) (hereafter, ELM-FATES). ELM is a land-model that, among many features, simulates the physics and conservative dynamics of water, energy and carbon fluxes. In particular, soil hydrologic fluxes are vertically resolved among discrete soil layers (1-D) [@Bonan:2013]. FATES is a community-based, open-source model used for studying climate-vegetation interactions. FATES is a vegetation demography model, with a size-structured group of plants (cohorts) and successional trajectory-based patches based on the ecosystem demography [@Moorcroft.2001] approach. FATES couples to ELM by a common interface of water and carbon fluxes. Detailed descriptions for ELM and FATES can be found elsewhere [@Fisher.2010; @Fisher.2015; @Koven:2020].

\
ELM-FATES parameterizes interception, throughfall, canopy drip, infiltration, evaporation, surface runoff, subsurface drainage, redistribution within the soil column, and groundwater discharge and recharge so as to simulate changes in canopy water $\Delta W_{can}$, surface water $\Delta W_{sfc}$, soil water $\Delta W_{liq, i}$ at depth z~i~ and water in an unconfined aquifer $\Delta W_{a}$ (omitting processes relevant to snow, wetlands or lakes), and conservation of these terms is expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta W_{can} + \Delta W_{sfc} + \sum_{i=1}^{15} \Delta W_{liq,i} + \Delta W_{a} = \left(q_{rain} - E_{v} - E_{g} - q_{over} - q_{h2osfc} - q_{drai}\right)\Delta t
\end{split}
(\#eq:water-balance)
\end{equation}

where, $q_{rain}$ is rainfall, $E_{v}$ is evapotranspiration (ET) of the forest, $E_{g}$ is ground evaporation, $q_{over}$ is surface runoff, $q_{h2osfc}$ is runoff from surface water storage, $q_{drai}$ is sub-surface drainage (all in mm H~2~O) and $\Delta t$ is the time-step (typically, 1 hour). The soil profile is discretized into 15 exponentially distributed soil layers with depth z $\simeq$ 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.21, 0.37, 0.62, 1, 1.7, 2.9, 4.7, 7.8, 13, 21 and 35 (m).

### Model parameterization
\
To parameterize ELM-FATES, we identified eleven parameters relevant for Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), determined their ranges based on literature for the study site or for the tropics (Table \@ref(tab:param)), and ran 5000 simulations using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) of this global parameter space. In the Conrad catchment, existing data on soil hydraulic conductivity for the depths of 12.5 and 60 cm showed a decline of conductivity by depth (@Kinner:2004; Table \@ref(tab:param)). We generated 5000 LHS samples within the 95% CI for the two depths and assumed a linear decline between each paired sample, while for depths < 12.5 cm and > 60 cm, we assumed the same value as that for depths 12.5 and 60 cm, respectively (Fig. S\@ref(fig:ksat-profiles) [Need to fix SI Figs. numbering to begin at 1]). For all runs, instead of ELM's default soil texture-based soil water retention curve, we used a curve that we derived using existing data on gravimetric water content vs. $\Psi_{soil}$ for depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m [@Kupers:2019]. We converted gravimetric water content to volumetric (VWC, $\theta$) using a bulk density value of of 0.8 g cm^-3^ measured at a point location (see below). A @Campbell.1974 empirical equation was fitted for all depths pooled together, as exploratory analyses indicated differences in water retention among depths were nominal,

\begin{equation}
\Psi_{soil} = \Psi_e\left(\frac{\theta}{\theta_{s}}\right)^{-b}
(\#eq:soil-ret-curve)
\end{equation}
where $\Psi_e$ is the air-entry matric potential (200, mm H~2~O), $\theta_{s}$ is the saturated volumetric water content (0.51, cm^3^ cm^-3^), and $b$, an index for soil pore-size distribution (10, unitless), respectively.

\
We ran ELM-FATES for the 5000-member parameter ensemble with hourly climate drivers from 1985-2018 [@Faybishenko.2020] initialized with the observed stand structure from the 50 ha plot [@Condit.2019a] in a single site mode. As our key interest here was in soil water availability rather than forest dynamics, we ran ELM-FATES in a lower-complexity configuration: static stand structure, and with a single plant functional type (PFT) of evergreen trees. The latter was chosen as only 9.7% of BCI crown area is dry-season deciduous and addition of a dry-deciduous PFT did not significantly alter results (not shown). Holding the stand structure static rather than allowing it to emerge from physiologically-mediated competition between trees removes a set of internal model feedbacks and thus enables a cleaner experimental design where the only differences between model simulations are the direct physiological effects of perturbed model parameters. 

\
We calibrated ELM-FATES over 2012-2018 against three key fluxes and states in Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), namely, (i) evapotranspiration ($ET \simeq E_{v} + E_{g}$) from the eddy flux tower (2012-2017; see [SI](#SIData.matteo)), (ii) stream discharge from the Conrad catchment ($q_{run} \simeq q_{over} + q_{drai}$; 2012-2018; see [SI](#SIData.steveP)) and (iii) soil volumetric water content (VWC, $\theta_{z} \simeq W_{liq, z}$) from two sources: a long-term (2012-2018) record of VWC from a point location near the eddy flux tower we built with a vertical TDR probe over 0-15 cm depth ($\theta_{0-0.15 m}$) and existing 50 ha plot-wide snap-shot measurements of VWC during the dry season of 2015 and 2016 for the depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m (1299 samples in total covering all soil types and habitats; see [SI](#SIData.VWC) and @Kupers:2019 for details; hereafter, $\theta_{0.15 m}$, $\theta_{0.4m}$ and $\theta_{1 m}$ refer to plot-wide averages).

For ELM-FATES calibration we calculated an objective function for each of the 5000-member ensemble by equally weighting standardized RMSE between observations and simulations across all fluxes and states. We describe the objective function $O$ as : 

\begin{align*}
\overline{O} = \frac{1}{6}\sum \left(RMSE^{*}(ET,~E_{v} + E_{g}) + RMSE^{*}(q_{run},~q_{over} + q_{drai}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0-0.15m}, {W_{liq,~\overline{z}}})\\
+ RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0.15m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[4]`m}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0.4m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[6]`m}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{1 m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[8]`m})\right)
(\#eq:obj-func)
\end{align*}

based on monthly sums for both $ET$ and $q_{run}$ and daily averages for $\theta$s. $W_{liq,~\overline{z}}$ is the daily average of $W_{liq,~z}$ for $z$ $\in$ {`r paste(soil.depths[1:4], collapse=", ")`} m. Superscript * indicates that RMSE is standardised between 0 and 1 across the 5000 simulations.

Preliminary analyses showed that minimising the objective function $\overline{O}$, that is, simultaneously fitting the model to all states and fluxes did not capture the soil moisture dynamics at 1 m depth well, our key priority for model calibration. To ensure model fit with soil moisture dynamics at 1 m depth, we first chose 300 parameter ensembles that minimised RMSE for VWC at the depth of 1m ($RMSE^{*}(\theta_{1 m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[8]`m})$ < 0.2), and among those 300 ensemble members we chose 100 members with the lowest values for the objective function $\overline{O}$. See Table \@ref(tab:param) for the ranges of best-fit values for different parameters. 

### Model evaluation
\
We evaluated ELM-FATES by calculating RMSE between simulated and observed long-term daily VWC for the depths of 0.1, 0.4 and 1 m (2016-2018), baesd on a dataset we had left-out during calibration. We obtained these observations from three horizontal time domain reflectometry probes at the depths of 0.1, 0.4 and 1 m at a point location near the eddy flux tower (see [SI](#SIData.VWC)).

\
We ran ELM-FATES with the chosen 100 ensemble members from 1985-2018, with the first 5 years used for model spin-up.

## Model for Effective Rooting Depth (ERD)
\
Water is a key limiting resource for tree growth. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and water supply as determined by soil moisture are factors known to influence water uptake [@Lawrence.2019]. In this study, we used leaf conductivity ($K_{leaf}$) determined by rhizosphere soil water potential ($\Psi_{soil}$) as an approximation of the soil water limiting factor. For dry-deciduous species seasonality in leaf cover may also influence plant water uptake. We therefore tested alternate models of growth, aka inverse models for ERD, in which a species' growth dynamics across census intervals was regressed against census interval means of multiplicative or additive effects of one or more factors calculated daily: VPD, $K_{leaf}$ and the leaf area index (LAI), all standardized between 0 and 1 (see below). For the chosen model (see Model Evaluation below), daily average growth for species $s$, $G_{s,~t~|~z}$, in the census interval $t$ for depth $z$ and for a given hydrauligoical realisation $h$ is described as follows (see SI for equations for all the tested models):

\begin{equation}
G_{s,~t~|~z,~h} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} (K^{*}_{leaf,~s,~i~|~z,~h} + VPD^{*}_{i}) LAI^{*}_{s,~doy~|~i}) + \epsilon_{t~|~z,~h}
(\#eq:M-chosen)
\end{equation}

where n~t~ be the total number of days in census interval *t*, the superscript * indicates that the variable has been standardized between 0 and 1, and $\epsilon$ is a normally distributed model error term. We estimated daily value of $K_{leaf,~s,~i~|~z,~h}$ for a species $s$ by substituting $\Psi_{soil,~i~|~z,~h}$ in the leaf vulnerability curves defined below in Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) using species-specific parameters $A_{s}$ and $B_{s}$ as:

\begin{equation}
K_{leaf,~s,~i~|~z,~h} = A_{s}e^{-B_{s}\Psi_{soil,~i~|~z,~h}}
(\#eq:k-soil)
\end{equation}

We estimated species effective rooting depths (ERD), defined as the depth ($z$) at which soil water dynamics ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) best explained observed dynamics of species growth (six 5-yearly censuses, 1990-2015). Using Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen), for a species $s$, we obtained Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$ for each soil depth $z$ for each of the 100 best-fit hydrological realizations. For each hydrological realization we retained only one depth that corresponded to the least AIC score (the best-fit), and within those depths retained the ones that had Pearson's $r$ >= 0.71 (or, $r^2$ >= 0.5) as a valid set. For a species $s$, we defined effective rooting depth (ERD) as the median of these set of depths, described as :

\begin{equation}
ERD_{s} = \underset{\forall \, h \, \in \, H}{median} \Big\{z,h\,\Big|\, \Big(AIC_{s~|~z,~h} = \underset{\forall \, z \,\in\,Z}{min}(AIC_{s~|~z,~h})\Big) \cap \Big(r_{s~|~z,~h} \ge 0.71\Big)\Big\}
(\#eq:erd)
\end{equation} 
where $H$ $\in$ {1, .., 100}, refer to the 100 hydrological realisations and $Z$ $\in$ {`r paste(soil.depths, collapse=", ")`} m, covering the range of soil depths in ELM-FATES after above parametarision.


### Model parameterization

#### Growth data
\
For growth estimates, to minimize the effect of light variation among trees, we selected only large trees ($\ge$ 30 cm dbh, the diameter at breast height) and species whose maximum height was $\ge$ 30 m (hereafter, canopy species) and thus are likely to be fully exposed to the sun. We selected trees for which the height of the diameter measurements were unchanged across all censuses (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015). For each individual tree (*i*), we calculated absolute growth rates ($G_{i,t}$; cm yr^-1^) for each of the five census intervals ($t$) as the difference between tree dbh measured in successive censuses, divided by the inter-census interval based on the exact date of measurements. We eliminated positive outliers as any growth rates amounting to > 75 mm yr^-1^, as this was the highest rate observed with confidence for fastest growing species [@Condit.2017]. Negative outliers were removed based on known measurement error, $\sigma_{e} = 0.006214d + 0.903$, where *d* is dbh. Any stem whose later dbh measurement fell < 4$\sigma_{e}$ the earlier measurement was removed [@Condit.2017]. As tree growth rates vary with size [@Muller-Landau:2006], to keep growth rates comparable across census intervals, we obtained residuals from a dbh model of tree growth based on a tree's dbh at the beginning of a census interval ($Resid_{i,t} = G_{i,t} - f(d_{i, t})$). The diameter model of growth ($f(d_{i, t})$), a B-spline based polynomial equation with 5 degrees of freedom, was fitted to growth rates from all trees pooled together as there was insufficient species-specific data for large trees (Fig. S\@ref(fig:dbh-model)). We retained only those trees that had $Resid_{i,t}$ estimates for all census intervals (total trees = `r sum(g.n$n)`) and standardized (centered and scaled) individual tree time series of $Resid_{i,t}$. We then obtained `r length(erd.sp)` species-level time-series of medians of $Resid_{i,t}$ ($G_{t}$). These were obtained for only those species with complete records on at least three trees (median *n* = `r median(g.n$n)`, max *n* = `r max(g.n$n)` trees per species).

\
There are many factors that could affect plant growth, including soil moisture, VPD, leaf area, temperature and radiation. Based on our preliminary analyses, incorporation of temperature and radiation did not improve our model fitting, thus we mainly focused on the impact of soil moisture, VPD and leaf area in our models.

#### Leaf Vulnerability Curves
\
We obtained leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves ($K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$; see Table \@ref(tab:symbols) for trait symbols and their definitions) for adult trees of 21 common species from Zailaa et al. (to be submitted; see SI for brief description of methods).

We chose the exponential function without the intercept to fit observed data across species, and as a general function to scale-up to the community, because it had the lowest AICc for most species, captured the form of the observed data across all species well, and had the lowest number of parameters, that is, two:

\begin{equation}
K_{leaf,~s} = A_{s}e^{-B_{s}\Psi_{leaf_{s}}} + error
(\#eq:vc-exp)
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are fitted species-specific parameters. From these fits we estimated species $K_{max,~leaf}$, $\Psi_{50,~leaf}$ and  $\Psi_{80,~leaf}$ (see Table 1). We identified scaling relationships between fitted parameters $A$ and $B$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) and two traits that were available at the community-scale, namely,  WSG and LMA (@Wright:2010; see SI for description of how data gaps were filled. We fitted polynomial equations described as,

\begin{equation}
A_{s} = `r acf[1]` `r acf[2]`B_{s} `r acf[3]`B_{s}^2 + `r acf[4]`B_{s}LMA_{s} + `r acf[5]`LMA_{s} `r acf.6`LMA_{s}^2 + error
(\#eq:a-mod)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B_{s} = `r bcf[1]` `r bcf[2]`WSG_{s} + `r bcf[3]`WSG_{s}^2 + `r bcf[4]`WSG_{s}LMA_{s} + `r bcf[5]`LMA_{s} `r bcf[6]`LMA_{s}^2 + error
(\#eq:b-mod)
\end{equation}

As these fits explained large proportion of variation in parameters $A$ and $B$ (see results), we sequentially used Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod) and \@ref(eq:a-mod) to predict parameters $B$ and $A$, respectively, for the `r length(unique(bci.AB$sp[!is.na(bci.AB$A)]))` species for which WSG and LMA were both available, retained `r length(unique(data.model.AB$sp))` for which parameters $A$ and $B$ were both positive, and fitted vulnerability curves to those (Eq. \#ref(eq:vc-exp)).

#### VPD
\
As VPD may have a non-linear relationship with growth, we fitted a polynomial curve between mean daily values by month of gross primary productivity (gC m^2^ day^-1^) and VPD (kPa) we collected from the eddy flux tower located 75 m from the 50-ha plot (for any day *i*, $GPP_i = `r vpd.cf[1]` + `r vpd.cf[2]`VPD_i + `r vpd.cf[3]`VPD_i^2 + error$; 2012-2017; Fig. S\@ref(fig:gpp-vpd)) and used standardized $GPP$ to represent the impact of VPD on growth (hereafter, standardized $GPP$ = $VPD^*$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen); range 0-1). At our study site, due to the coincidence of higher temperature, higher radiation, and lower humidity during the dry season, the impact of VPD may as well be a combined impact of not only temperature and humidity, but also radiation.

#### Leaf Area Index (LAI)
\
To explore the effect of species seasonality in leaf phenology on growth, we assumed species-specific seasonal curves for leaf area index ($LAI$, range 0-1, unitless). For evergreen species we assumed $LAI$ = 1 throughout the year, whereas for non-evergreen species (various deciduous classes), we assumed $LAI$ = 1 during the wet season (DOY = 150 to 300) given the high forest-level leaf area index for this period (not shown), and obtained an estimate of $LAI$ for the rest of the year as follows. We interpolated species-specific weekly leaf-fall data collected at two similar sites in BCI (1985-2020) to a daily estimate, scaled to express daily leaf fall as a fraction of the total leaf fall in a given year and obtained an average leaf fall fraction by DOY estimate across years ($LeafFall$, range 0-1, unitless). Thus for non-evergreen species, we cumulatively deducted $LeafFall$ from $LAI$ = 1 beginning DOY = 300 and obtained a $LAI$ by DOY curve (Fig. S\@ref(fig:leaf-cover)). We obtained species-specific parameters $A$ & $B$ for Eq. \@ref(eq:k-soil) either from data when available, or a model based on $LMA$ or $WSG$ as described in the earlier section, and used standardized K within species ($K^*$; range 0-1) in Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen).

### Model evaluation
\
For each model of ERD (Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen) and Eqs. in SI), species ERD was regressed against species xylem sap $\delta^2H$ (permil). We used xylem sap $\delta^2H$ values given in @Meinzer:2001 for the dry-season of March 1997 as this period showed largest seasonal divergence among species, with a corresponding gradient of $\delta^2H$ in the soil (Fig. S\@ref(fig:iso-data)). We removed species that are likely to be deciduous in March as xylem sap $\delta^2H$ of these species may not be linked with water sourced at the time of measurement and thus may not be comparable with other species that had leaves. We also removed *G. standleyana*, whose xylem sap isotope value was not well constrained by the soil water isotope depth profile. We were thus left with 7 species with data on $\delta^2H$ as well as modelled estimates of ERD.

## ERD Coordination with Above-ground Hydraulic Traits
\
To evaluate whether ERD was associated with above-ground hydraulic traits (*n* = 8 species with both datasets), we regressed species ERD with maximum stem hydraulic conductance ($K_{max, stem}$), leaf turgor loss point ($\Psi_{tlp}$), vulnerability to embolism from cavitation measured in terms of pressure at which 88% of stem hydraulic conductivity is lost ($\Psi_{88,~stem}$), and hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$). See [SI](#SIData.brett) for data collection and estimation of these variables.

## Mortality Analyses and Extreme Drought Experience
\
We calculated mortality rates for large trees ($\ge$ 10 cm dbh) of species with ERD estimates (all canopy species with maximum height $\ge$ 30 m) and average abundance of at least 20 trees (one species with an average abundance of 9 trees was eliminated; *n* = `r length(erd.mrate.sp)`). For each of the seven census intervals ($t$) in the 35-yr record (1982, 1985, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2015), species $Mort_{t}$ (% yr^-1^) for two successive censuses (cen~1~ and cen~2~) was calculated as $Mort_{t} = \frac{D_{cen_{2}}}{N_{cen_{1}}}.\frac{100}{time}$, where $N_{cen_{1}}$ and $D_{cen_{1}}$ are the total number of trees of a species present in cen~1~ and dead in cen~2~, respectively, in the 50 ha plot and $time$ is the duration based on mean dates of cen~1~ and cen~2~. For each species we calculated mean mortality rate across all intervals as $Mort_{mean} = \frac{1}{6}\sum_{t=1}^{6} {Mort_{t}}$. To test whether ERD plays a role in alleviating mortality risk, we regressed species ERD against species ($Mort_{mean}$). To assess whether this may be due to deeper ERD species escaping the experience of catastrophic soil drought, we calculated the proportion of days over the $\Psi_{soil,~z}$ simulation period (1990-2015) for which soil water potential in the soil zone matching species ERD ($\Psi_{soil,~z = ERD}$) were below species $\Psi_{crit}$, which was defined as $\Psi_{50,~leaf}$.

\
All statistical analyses were done in R statistical environment (version 3.5.3, @R:2019).

# Results
## Soil Water Dynamics By Depth
\
The ELM-FATES simulations with the chosen best-fit parameter ensembles (Table \@ref(tab:param)) successfully captured the dynamics of soil moisture by depth (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)A & Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)B), including the observations from the horizontal TDR probes that were not included in the calibration. These simulations also simultaneously captured the dynamics in stream discharge (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)C) and evapotranspiration (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)D). The reduction in parameter range in the best-fit ensembles compared to the global ranges tested showed that the above calibration was sensitive to the following parameters: the Ball-Berry stomatal slope parameter, the ELM rooting distribution parameter that regulates the depth of the rooting profile, soil hydraulic conductivity profile especially at depth, and our adjustment factor to soil hydraulic conductivity to account for macroporosity and direct flow paths (Table \@ref(tab:param)). Soil Water Potential dynamics ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) by depth (z = 0.1 through 13) obtained from the best-fit simulations revealed that census intervals varied in soil droughts in terms of intensity at depth, seasonality and duration (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-droughts)). Nevertheless, across the simulation period (1990-2015) $\Psi_{soil,~z}$ remained above -0.5 MPa from depths 1.7 to 13 m (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-all-depths)).

## Leaf Vulnerability Curves
\
For the leaf vulnerability curve parameters $A$ and $B$ fitted to the observed data on $K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$, $WSG$ and parameter $B$ explained a large proportion of variation in parameter $A$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:a-mod); *Adj. R*^2^ = `r afit.r2`; *P* `r  afit.p`; also see Fig. S\@ref(fig:ab-fit)). $WSG$ and $LMA$ explained a large proportion of variation in parameter $B$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod); Adj. *R*^2^ = `r bfit.r2`; *P* `r  bfit.p`). WSG alone explained `r round(a.wsg.r2*100,0)` % of variation in $A$ ($A = `r a.wsg.cf[1]` `r a.wsg.cf[2]`B + `r a.wsg.cf[3]`B^2 + error$; *P* `r  a.wsg.p`) and `r round(b.wsg.r2*100,0)` % of variation in $B$ ($B = `r b.wsg.cf[1]` `r b.wsg.cf[2]`B + `r b.wsg.cf[3]`B^2 + error$; *P* `r  b.wsg.p`). Parameter $B$ alone explained `r round(a.b.r2*100,0)` % of variation in $A$ (*P* `r  a.b.p`), while $LMA$ alone was weakly related to $A$ and was not related to $B$ (not shown). Leaf vulnerability curves fitted to observed data on `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)` species as well as percent loss of conuctivity curves are shown in Fig. S\@ref(fig:obs-plc-curves). Vulnerability curves were predicted using Eqs. \@ref(eq:a-mod)-\@ref(eq:b-mod) for `r sp.n.model` species for which such curves were unavailable (out of `r length(unique(erd.iso$sp))` species for which ERD was determined (Fig.  S\@ref(fig:obs-comm-plc-curves). 


## Effective Rooting Depths, Vulnerability to Embolism and Hydraulic Safety Margins
\
In comparison to the measured isotopic signal ($\delta^2H$), our results showed that the ERD model with the effect of LAI and an additive effect of VPD (Eq. \@ref(eq:M2)) had highest goodness-of-fit (*R*^2^ = 0.65; *P* = 0.027; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-iso)). The model without LAI and an additive effect of VPD showed no species with sufficient species-level goodness-of-fit. All the other ERD models showed a positive but non-significant relationship with $\delta^2H$ at $\alpha$ = 0.05 (Fig. S\@ref(fig:other-erd-mods)). For the rest of the analyses we therefore used species ERD estimates from the model with with the effect of LAI and an additive effect of VPD (Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen)). Notably, two species, *L. seemannii* and *T. tuberculata*, that @Meinzer:1999 found to have xylem sap $\delta^2H$ values between soil water and groundwater, suggesting that these species sourced most of the water from depths > 1 m, were also identified by our model with ERD > 1 m (2.9 m for both species; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-iso)).

In this forest modeled effective rooting depths (ERD) for the `r length(erd.sp)` large, canopy tree species varied from `r min(df.erd.to.plot$depth)` m to `r max(df.erd.to.plot$depth)` m (Fig. \@ref(fig:sp-erd)). For the subset of species for which hydraulic properties were available, species with deeper ERD showed greater maximum stem hydraulic conductance ($K_{max,~stem}$, *R*^2^ = 0.39, *P* = 0.098, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)A), less negative leaf $\Psi_{tlp}$ (*R*^2^ = 0.6, p = 0.024, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)B), less negative $\Psi_{88,~stem}$ and thus greater vulnerability to embolism from cavitation (*R*^2^ = 0.72, p = 0.007, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)C), and narrower hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$; *R*^2^ = 0.74, p = 0.013, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)D).

## Effective Rooting Depths, Experienced Drought and Mortality
\
Species with deeper ERD showed lower mean mortality rates across the 34-yr record (1982-2015; *R*^2^ = 0.11, *P* = 0.075, *n* = `r length(erd.mrate.sp)`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-mort)). For five out of seven census intervals, species with shallower ERD had significantly higher mortality anomalies than deeper ERD species (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-mort-census)). Analysis of time spent under catastrophic soil drought showed that the proportion of days species $\Psi_{ERD}$ was more negative than species $\Psi_{crit}$ decreased with species ERD (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-time)). Species with ERD deeper than 1 m did not cross species $\Psi_{crit}$ for the entire 25-yr period for which soil water potential $\Psi_{soil,~z}$ was modeled (1990-2015), as soil depths below 1 m remained above `r round(psi.1.7.min$median, 2)` MPa (`r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q97.5), 2)`, `r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q2.5), 2)`;  median, 95% CI) through all the dry seasons and drought periods, which is above ($\Psi_{crit}$) of the most sensitive tree species (-0.28 MPa).

# Discussion
\
Our analyses revealed that co-occurring large canopy tree species (*n* = `r length(erd.sp)`) with deeper effective rooting depths (ERD) were associated with higher hydraulic efficiency, but not safety. Deep ERD species showed higher maximum stem hydraulic conductance, but greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower hydraulic safety margins compared to shallow ERD species. This trade-off translated into greater drought tolerance, as deeper ERD species showed lower mortality rates than shallower ERD species over the 35-yr record (1982-2015). Analysis of time spent below ($\Psi_{crit}$) in the soil zone matching ERD $\Psi_{soil,~z = ERD}$ showed that this was likely due to decreasing realized risk of hydraulic failure with increasing rooting depth. We thus show, for the first time, that inter-specific variation in trees' effective rooting depths aligns species on a conservative-acquisitive water economic spectrum by demonstrating a link between trees' realized drought experience, hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes. On the acquisitive end of the spectrum were deep ERD species with a  hydraulically efficient, but risky, suite of traits optimized for an environment of reliable and abundant source of water at depth that resulted in a lower mortality risk. At the conservative end of the spectrum were shallow ERD species with inefficient, but safer, xylem likely optimized for high variability in $\Psi_{soil}$ in the shallow soil layers, and resulting in higher variance in mortality rates across censuses as $\Psi_{soil,~z = ERD}$ crossed ERD $\Psi_{crit}$. Mortality rates of shallow ERD species may have been exacerbated by increased drought events during the study period. @Condit.2017 showed that half of the extreme dry seasons (< 1 SD annual water deficit) during 1931-2015 (85-yr) occurred during 1982-2005 (24-yr) of the 34-yr long study period (1982-2015).

### Realised drought risk integral to assessing drought-vulnerability
\
Our study brings attention to the need for assessing drought-sensitivity in terms of species realized drought risk. We found that species accessing deeper water had greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower branch hydraulic safety margins, that is, traits that are commonly identified as proxies for mortality risk, but they were less droughted and had lower mortality compared to species relying on shallower water through a study period of greater recurrence of drought. These results are consistent with the two studies that included three or four species each with known rooting or water sourcing depths and assessed their hydraulic traits and mortality rates during extreme droughts [@Johnson:2018fad; @Nardini:2015]. @Johnson:2018fad found that mortality decreased with deep rooting even though deep rooted species were more vulnerable to xylem cavitation (high $\Psi_{88,~stem}$) and had narrower safety-margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$). @Nardini:2015 found that a species sourcing deep water in a Karst system showed lower hydraulic failure and mortality in an extreme drought despite having high $\Psi_{88,~stem}$ and narrower safety margin compared to two species sourcing shallow-water.

\
Our result of lower mortality in deep rooted trees contrasts with the finding of @Chitra-Tarak.2018 in which species identified by their inverse ERD model as effectively deep rooted died *more* in a prolonged, extreme drought. Their hydrological model revealed that the multi-annual drought exhausted the deep water reservoir for over two years, whereas our hydrological modeling at BCI finds that despite higher frequency of droughts during our study period, $\Psi_{soil}$ remained above `r round(psi.1.7.min$median, 2)` (`r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q97.5), 2)`, `r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q2.5), 2)`; median, 95% CI) below the depth of 1 m through all the dryseasons and drought periods, that is above ($\Psi_{crit}$) of the most sensitive tree species (-0.28 MPa). The difference in our results are likely attributable to site differences in the precipitation regime. In their dry forest site (Mudumalai National Park, India) precipitation is low: 1095 $\pm$ 296 mm (mean $\pm$ SD) compared to `r round(rain.man.stats$rain)` $\pm$ `r round(rain.man.stats$rain.sd)` mm (`r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`) at BCI, and precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratio at Mudumalai is nearly one (Penman-Monteith PET = 980 $\pm$ 64 mm), whereas at BCI it is nearly two (Penman-Monteith PET = `r round(mean(clim$pet.PM))` $\pm$ `r round(sd(clim$pet.PM))` mm;`r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`; this study, @Guo.2016), and thus at BCI deep soil layers are effectively recharged annually (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-all-depths); @Chitra-Tarak.2018). The variation in mortality explained by ERD in our study is low (*R*^2^ = 0.11, *P* = 0.075), and other causes may explain observed mortality [@McDowell.2018]. 

### Effective rooting depths at the tree community level
\
By estimating ERD for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` canopy tree species, we make an important advance in modeling effective rooting depths at the community level in species species-rich tropical forests. Our chosen ERD model is an advance over the only other inverse model of ERD (@Chitra-Tarak.2018; *n* = 12 species) in terms of physiologically meaningful representation, fewer parameters and corroboration with tree and soil data on $\delta^2H$. The model in @Chitra-Tarak.2018 estimated six species-specific phenomenological parameters: three as root fraction for corresponding lumped vadose zone layers, and three as shape parameters for water uptake vs availability curves. For each species, they calculated daily water uptake successively from three layers, that is, the supply, to satisfy the demand of the daily maximum evapotranspiration, a function of PET and LAI. They regressed total supply to total demand ratio over census intervals as a growth coefficient against growth (five data points), and chose values for six parameters that best-fit (highest *R*^2^, that is, two additional parameters). Our inverse ERD model fits only two parameters by way of regressing depth-specific model against five growth data points. Our model was constrained on VPD and species leaf vulnerability curves, variables that are shown to be physiologically meaningful.

\
We benefited from finding a strong scaling relationship between commonly collected 'soft' traits at the community scale (LMA and WSG) and parameters of leaf vulnerability (or percent loss of conductance, (PLC)) curves for which we collected data on a few species (*n* = `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)`), a 'hard' trait. This allowed us to scale-up the leaf vulnerability curves at the community scale (*n* = `r length(ab.table$Species)` species, see Table S\@ref(tab:ab-param) for model predicted parameters). We find that leaf conductance declined more rapidly with declining $\Psi_{leaf}$ for species with higher values of WSG and LMA (Fig. S\@ref(fig:obs-plc-curves)). Whether such scaling relationships between hard and soft traits hold true for other forests, and their wider applicability, remains to be seen as data on PLC curves are limited in tropical forests, but supportive and counter examples both exist [@McCulloh.2011; @Hoffmann.2011].

\ Deurwaerder.2020
Another important piece of information is stable water isotopes of xylem water and below-ground sources, in the vadose zone and water table. Although the interpretation of these data is still under research (Deurwaerder et al., 2020), they are critical for model calibration or validation.  The model in @Chitra-Tarak.2018 were not corroborated with such data as existing methods were inadequate to extract water bound to the saprolite found in their dry forest study site (Jean Riotte, pers. comm.). The model of below-ground water-availability in this study (ELM-FATES) is far more advanced compared to that used by @Chitra-Tarak.2018 and was calibrated with data on long-term soil moisture dynamics at a point location (0-0.15m) and plot-wide measurements by depth (0.15, 0.4 and 1 m), as well as, evapotranspiration and stream discharge. @Chitra-Tarak.2018 was calibrated only on stream discharge and water table levels. We lacked data on water table levels which would have been useful to constrain water availability dynamics in the unobserved soil layers and the spatial variability within the plot. As in @Chitra-Tarak.2018, we also interpret our ERD estimates as revealing relative differences among species' effective rooting depths rather than in absolute terms.

### Future Directions for Model Development
\
The trade-offs that we identify between above- and below-ground traits, the water environment vertically below-ground and mortality rates are important for representing diversity in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models especially in species-rich forests. The hydraulic efficiency-safety trade-off between high values of maximum leaf or stem conductivity (high $K_{max}$) and cavitation-resistance (low $\Psi_{50}$ or $\Psi_{88}$) is hypothesized although community-wide examples are rare [@Hacke:2006; @Gleason.2016]. Such a trade-off is found at our study site at both leaf and stem level (Zailaa et al. to be submitted; Wolfe et al. in revision). We also found that LMAand WSG were strong predictors of PLC curves for leaves, but not for stems (not shown). Acquisitive traits such as high $K_{max}$ are expected to be associated with faster growth rates. We found a positive but non- significant relationship of adult growth rates ($\ge$ 10cm dbh) with $K_{max, ~leaf}$ (*R*^2^ = 0.13; *P* = 0.126, *n* = `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)`) and no relationship with $K_{max, ~stem}$ (*n* = `r stem.traits.sp` species). The relationships between ERD and above-ground hydraulic traits that we find will provide an important insight on how to model rooting depths and their coordination or trade-offs with other traits in order to better represent the functional diversity of tropical forests.

\
Our model estimated ERD as a single value, unlike the dynamic ERD modeled by @Chitra-Tarak.2018, but future model developments should investigate seasonal dynamics of ERD, using corresponding calibration data on isotopically determined water-sourcing depths. Our inverse ERD model was parameterized on 5-yearly growth data, with five data points over a 25-yr period, which decouples climate events and demographic outcomes. Future studies could better constrain the model with higher resolution growth data such as those from dendrometer bands. This is especially important for modeling seasonally dynamic ERD. However, trees' stem diameter change is a sum total of not just growth, the addition of wood, but also changes due to hydrostatic stem flexing, importance of which increases with temporal resolution [@Chitra-Tarak.2016; @Chitra-Tarak.2015]. Use of dendrometer data would thus entail accounting for stem hydrostatic flexing [@Zweifel:2018]. Three of our exploratory ERD models included seasonality in leaf area fraction, but we did not select them as they worsened the fit with growth data and evaluation data ($\delta^2H$, Fig. S\@ref(fig:other-erd-mods)). We interpret this result as that VPD and PLC curves may be adequate to explain growth, but also acknowledge that our estimates of seasonality of LAI is a tentative estimate combining leaf fall data and assumption of leaf presence during the wet season, and omits inter-annual variation. Future studies could make use of data from new technologies such as drone based monitoring of species-specific leaf area fraction in species-rich forests [@Park.2019]. In forests such as BCI where understory tree growth is more limited by availability of light rather than water, inversely estimating ERD for smaller tree size classes, especially from a few growth data points, may need accounting for variation in trees' light environment over time and among trees of the same size class, an issue we minimized by limiting ERD estimates to canopy trees. To estimate topographic variation in ERD within or across species future studies may use soil moisture dynamics from a distributed hydrological model [e.g. @Schwantes:2018]. We note that data availability on soil water retention curve ($\Psi_{soil}$ vs. VWC), hydraulic conductivity ($K_{soil}$) by depth, soil moisture by depth, stream discharge and evapotranspiration were important for effective calibration of our 1-D hydrological model. We recommend wide-spread data collection of these variables as well as water-table levels in forest-inventory sites to allow for estimation of trees' water environments. Finally, developing an inverse ERD model that accounts for movement of water within the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum (SPAC) would be a step change from the current statistical models of ERD (this study and @Chitra-Tarak.2018). Although data needs for parameterizing such models [@Christoffersen:2016kd2d; @Sperry.1998] could be greater (e.g. retention curves for roots), which limits immediate community-wide application, such models hold greater promise to improve our understanding of plant physiology [e.g. see @Johnson:2018fad].

# Conclusions

Establishing relationships between plant's environment, traits and demographic outcomes is imperative for developing a predictive plant ecology, but trees realized water environments and water-access are rarely studied. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a mechanistic link between trees' realized drought experience, above-ground hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes for a species-rich forest. The role of deep-water access that we find in alleviating mortality of drought-sensitive trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of tropical forest dynamics under current and future climate. Our community-scale framework for modeling effective rooting depths or leaf vulnerability curves indicate the possibilities in expanding the use of critical, hard-earned observations in species-rich forests towards community-scale generalizations.

## Data Descriptions 

### Microclimatic tower {#SIData.matteo}

The tower used for these measurements is 41 m above ground, on a plateau on BCI [@Pau.2018]. The eddy covariance system includes a sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) and an open-path infrared CO2/H2O gas analyzer (LI7500, LiCOR. Lincoln, NE). Hi-frequency (10Hz) measurements were acquired by a datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific) and stored on a local PC. Data were processed with a custom program using a standard routine described in [@Detto.2010]. QA/QC criteria for removing erroneous values are listed in table 1 (see below). GPP was derived from daytime values of NEE by adding the corresponding mean daily ecosystem respiration obtained as the intercept of the light response curve [@Lasslop.2010]. The light curve was fitted on a 15-days moving window using a rectangular hyperbolic function (runs with friction velocity less than 0.4 m s^-1^ were excluded). In order to compute daily time integrated budgets, gaps were filled using Artificial Neural Network [@Papale.2003] with hydro-meteorological inputs as predictors (soil moisture, solar radiation, temperature, VPD and air pressure, all measured on the same tower). To train the network, the dataset was randomly divided in a training set (70%), a validation set (15%) and a test set (15%). A two-layer feed-forward network with 10 sigmoid hidden neurons and linear output neurons, was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm until the mean square error (MSE) of the validation set stop improving [@Hagan.1994]. Performance, in term of MSE, was evaluated using the test set at the end of the training. This procedure was repeated 100 times to produce 100 estimates of GPP. Training multiple times generates different results due to different initial conditions and random sampling of the three sets. Ensemble was obtained as weighted average from the 100 ANN predictions using the MSE of the test set as weights according to:

$f_{i} = \frac{\sum_{k}f_{ik}^{ANN}/{MSE_{ik}}}{\sum_{k}1/{MSE_{ik}}}$

The ANN was implemented using the Neural Network Toolbox in Matlab 2014a. 

### Stream discharge from the Conrad catchment (#SIData.steveP)

The Conrad weir is located on the gently sloping western side of Barro Colorado Island. The weir consists of a 90 degree ‘V’ notch with a rectangular upper section. The weir was constructed in several stages between 1993 and 1996. Stream stage is recorded at 5-minute intervals.

The weir drains a catchment of approximately 40 ha of which at least 90% consists of the central plateau area of the island. Peak flow usually follows peak rain by approximately 2-3 hours. Large storms are sometimes preceded by small, initial peaks generated by the rain falling on the steeper slopes close to the weir.

Streamflow data are analyzed by software custom-built by author SP. The program is used to correct for blockages of the weir ‘V’ by fallen vegetation (a common occurrence), sensor drift, small gaps and other problems. Discharge is then calculated using an empirically derived rating curve calculated for each 1mm stream stage.

### Volumetric Water Content

We collected volumetric water content (VWC) data (2012-2018) from a point location at the eddy flux tower with a vertical time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe. The relationship between the output from the TDR probe and VWC was calibrated based on measurements of gravimetric water content (GWC) on several occasions from representative soils near the vertical probe (0-0.15 m) (Fig. S\@ref(fig:TDR-calib)). GWC was converted to VWC based on the observed mean bulk dry density of 0.8 g cm^-3^ near the TDR probe (*n* = 5, cylinder volume = 1250 cm^3^). Beginning in 2016 we additionally installed three horizontal probes at depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m and we applied the same calibration equation to these data (2016-2018) as that for the vertical probe. 

We also leveraged exisiting GWC measurements by @Kupers:2019 at the depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m in summer 2015 (February, March and April) and 0.15, 0.4 in summer 2016 (March)--1299 samples that covered all soil types and habitats in the plot. The sampling periods were 6, 5, 10 and 8 days long, respectively. The 2016 dry season was associated with the 2015–2016 El Niño (see @Kupers:2019 for further details). We converted these GWC measurements to VWC assuming a bulk density of 0.8 g cm^-3^. $\theta_{0.15 m}$, $\theta_{0.4 m}$ and $\theta_{1 m}$ refer to the plot-wide VWC averages by depth over each sampling period. Middle date of a sampling period is used for comparison with model simulations.

### Leaf maximum hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation {#SIData.joseph}

The Kleaf was measured under steady state and high irradiance following the Evaporative Flux Method (FEM) [@Sack.2011]  using a flowmeter. Briefly, the leaf is excised under filtered DI water and attached to a water source (graduated cylinder) using clear plastic tubing. The system includes tubing of a known resistance, separated upstream and downstream by two sensors measuring the transpiration-driven water flow pressure in the EFM system [@Sack.2011]. The K~leaf~ is calculated as the ratio of the transpiration rate (E~leaf~; mmol s^-1^) to the difference in flow pressure (MPa) upstream and downstream from the resistance tubing, and further standardized to 25°C and by leaf area. At stability (CV < 5%), the leaf is left to equilibrate in plastic bags with moist paper towels and measured for \Psi~leaf~ using a Scholander pressure chamber. To construct vulnerability curves for each species, four different functions were fitted to species-specific K~leaf~ vs. \Psi~leaf~ data using the *anneal* optimization function in the R package likelihood: exponential without an intercept ($K_{leaf} = Ae^{-B\Psi_{leaf}}$), exponential with an intercept ($K_{leaf} = C + Ae^{-B\Psi_{leaf}}$), logistic ($K_{leaf} = \frac{A}{1 + \left(\frac{\Psi_{leaf}}{x_{0}}\right)^B}$) and sigmoidal ($K_{leaf} = \frac{A}{1 + e^{-\left(\frac{\Psi_{leaf} - x_{0}}{B}\right)}}$). The differences among AICc values for these functions were not large within species (Zailaa et al. to be submitted; (see Zailaa et al. for more detailed methods description).

### Stem maximum hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation {#SIData.brett}

Brett to edit.

Methods for Stem Maximum hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation closely followed [Christman.2012] and [Wolfe.2016]. Values for some of the species reported here were previously reported by @Dickman.2019 and @Wu.2020. The entire dataset and R script for the analyses are archived in the NGEE-Tropics archive (Wolfe 2020, To be done).
\
Canopy branches were cut from 4–10 trees of 26 species across three sites (Table SXX). The branch segments were enclosed in opaque plastic bags, and brought to the laboratory for measurements. Stem segments used for hydraulic conductivity (Kh) measurements were located at least 1 m from the cut end of the branch to minimize the number of open vessels that extended into the segment. Maximum vessel length was measured on a subset of samples from each species. Among species, maximum vessel length ranged XXX and length of stem between the cut that was made in the air to collect the branch and the section of stem used for Kh measurement was XXX (Table SXX).
\
Three leaves that were distal to the Kh segment were sealed in plastic bags and the entire branch was enclosed in black plastic bags for at least 30 minutes to stop transpiration. Just prior to measurement of Kh, leaf water potential of the three bagged leaves was measured with a pressure chamber. Since transpiration was stopped by bagging the leaves, leaf water potential was assumed to equal stem water potential (REFERENCE).
\
For each Kh segment, three measurements of stem water potential were made on stem sections that were located adjacent to the Kh segment. Stem sections that were approximately 40 mm in length were placed in nickel-plated aluminum chambers that were connected to Peltier-type psychrometers (Merrill Instruments, Logan, UT) and placed in a water bath at 30°C for 3 h to equilibrate the humidity within the cambers. Then water potential was measured using an automated multi-channel micro-voltmeter (CR7, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) with a 10 s thermocouple cooling current. For samples with water potential < -4 MPa, a 45 s cooling current was used to improve accuracy. Each psychrometer probe was calibrated against salt solutions beforehand and the plateau of the psychromatic response curve was used to assess water potential.
\
The Kh segments were removed from the branches by repeatedly cutting back the branch on both ends while it was submerged in water to relax the hydraulic tension within the xylem ((REFERENCE)). Then the ends were shaved clean with a fresh razor. Segments were 11–34 cm in length (mean ± SD = 22 ± 4 cm) and 0.2–1.6 cm in diameter (0.7 ± 0.2 cm). The segments were placed in a hydraulic conductivity apparatus similar to that described by Sperry et al. (1998) except that flow rate was measured with graduated pipettes instead of a balance. The perfusion solution was 10 mM KCl filtered to 0.2 m. For each segment, we measured the flow rate at three pressure heads: two that ranged 0.5–2 kPa and at zero pressure. Following Torres-Ruiz et al. (2012), Kh was calculated as the slope of the flow rate versus pressure gradient (i.e., pressure head divided by segment length) among the three pressure heads. Stem area specific hydraulic conductivity was (Ks) was calculated by dividing Kh by the cross-sectional area of stem. To calculate cross-sectional stem area, stem diameter was measured twice perpendicularly on both ends of the segment and averaged, then area was calculated assuming a circular cross section.
\
To assess vulnerability to cavitation, the branches were allowed to dry in the lab for 0 – 180 hours before they were measured for stem water potential and Ks. We used the water potential measured by the psychrometers because they are a more direct measurement. It has been noted that bagged-leaf water potential can deviate from stem water potential, especially when branch segments are relatively dry (REFERENCE). For some species, we noted this pattern while for others it was not apparent (Fig SXX). For each species, Ks was plotted against stem water potential and a Weibull curve was fit through the 90th  percentile of the points, following Wolfe et al. (2016)). The intercept of the curve was interpreted as maximum Ks and the water potential where the Weibull curve predicted 12, 50, 80, and 88 loss of maximum Ks were interpreted as P12, P50, P80, and P88, respectively.

### Data gaps in WSG and LMA {#SIData.rutuja}

Among the `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)` species with observed data on ($K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$) used to build the community-level models of leaf vulnerability curves (Eqs. \@ref(eq:b-mod)-\@ref(eq:a-mod)), two lacked data on WSG and five on LMA~lamina~. We filled three gaps in LMA using predictions from a strong linear relationship between LMA and LMA~disc~, the latter defined as the mean leaf mass per unit area measured for a 1.483 cm^2^ leaf disc taken to avoid veins (g m^-2^) for leaves receiving direct sunlight ($\overline{LMA} = `r disc.cf[1]` + `r disc.cf[2]`LMA_{disc}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r disc.r2`; *P* `r disc.p`, *n* = `r disc.n`). We filled the two remaining gaps in LMA using predictions from a linear relationship between LMA and LMA~lamina~, as measured during the smaller, $K_{leaf}$ campaign ($\overline{LMA} = `r lma.cf[1]` + `r lma.cf[2]`LMA_{lamina}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r lma.r2`; *P* `r lma.p`, *n* = `r lma.n`). We chose not to fill the two data gaps in WSG as available data were poor predictors of WSG.

\
At the community level, we filled data gaps in $LMA$ for `r sum(c.lma.gaps[-which(names(c.lma.gaps) == "original")])` species (of total `r sum(c.lma.gaps)`)  using linear relationships with other variables: `r c.lma.gaps[[which(names(c.lma.gaps) == "filled-LMA-DISC")]]` species with $LMA_{disc}$, `r c.lma.gaps[[which(names(c.lma.gaps) == "filled-LMA-Nobby")]]` with $LMA_{lamina}$, and `r c.lma.gaps[[which(names(c.lma.gaps) == "filled-LEAF")]]` with $LMA_{leaf}$, defined as the mean leaf mass per unit area measured for the entire leaf including the petiole (g m^-2^) for leaves receiving direct sunlight ($\overline{LMA} = `r leaf.cf[1]` + `r leaf.cf[2]`LMA_{leaf}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r leaf.r2`; *P* `r leaf.p`, *n* = `r leaf.n`). For the `r sum(c.lma.gaps)` species thus with $LMA$, we gap-filled data on  WSG for `r sum(c.wsg.gaps[-which(names(c.wsg.gaps) == "original")])` species using a linear relationship with wood specific gravity reported by @Chave:2009 ($\overline{WSG} = `r chave.cf[1]` + `r chave.cf[2]`WSG_{chave}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r chave.r2`; *P* `r chave.p`, *n* = `r chave.n`).

## Alternative models for Effective Rooting Depth (ERD)

Below we present all the altervative models for Effective Rooting Depth (ERD). Daily average species-specific growth, G~t | z~, in the census interval *t* given an ERD of depth *z*, is described as follows: 

\begin{equation}
G_{t~|~z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,~i~|~z}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t~|~z}
(\#eq:M1)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t~|~z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,~i~|~z}^{*} VPD_{i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t~|~z}
(\#eq:M2)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t~|~z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,~i~|~z}^{*} + VPD_{i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t~|~z}
(\#eq:M3)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t~|~z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,~i~|~z}^{*} LAI_{doy~|~i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t~|~z}
(\#eq:M4)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t~|~z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} (K^{*}_{leaf,~i~|~z} + VPD^{*}_{i}) LAI^{*}_{doy~|~i}) + \epsilon_{t~|~z}
(\#eq:M5)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t~|~z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,~i~|~z}^{*}VPD_{i}^{*}LAI_{doy~|~i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t~|~z}
(\#eq:M6)
\end{equation}
where n~t~ be the total number of days in census interval *t*, the superscript * indicates that the variable has been standardized between 0 and 1, and $\epsilon$ is a normally distributed model error term.
