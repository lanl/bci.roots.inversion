# Summary

- Among the mechanisms plants employ to deal with drought, deep water access is arguably the most commonly invoked, but under-studied. Vulnerability to embolism and hydraulic safety margins are shown to be predictors of drought-induced mortality risk, but deep-water access may delay plants from reaching these critical thresholds. Here, we tested the role of deep-water access in survival strategies of a diverse tropical forest community (Panama) using a novel data-model approach. 
- We inversely modeled effective rooting depth (ERD) for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` canopy species by linking growth dynamics (1990-2015) to vapor pressure deficit, water potentials in the whole-soil column, and a new community-scale model of species leaf vulnerability curves. We evaluated ERD against existing isotopic tracer data on trees and soil. 
- We find that deeper ERD is associated with higher stem hydraulic conductivity, greater vulnerability to xylem embolism, narrower safety margins, and lower mortality rates over 35 years. Deeper ERD species spent less time below critical hydraulic thresholds indicating that trees mitigate water-stress related mortality risk through deep water access.
- The role of deep-water access in alleviating mortality of drought-sensitive trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of tropical forest dynamics under current and future climate.

# Introduction
\
Tropical forests play a disproportionately large role in the global carbon and energy cycle, and support half of global biodiversity [@Bonan:2008; @Wright:20050th], but face a threat from intensifying droughts [@Doughty:2015; @Xu.2019]. Tropical forests are logically considered to be an especially drought-vulnerable biome given the combination of climate risk and vegetation sensitivity [@Meir:2015trw], yet mortality events in the tropics are rarely as large as those in the temperate and boreal zones (McDowell et al. 2018), leading to questions regarding the role of large trait-diversity in mitigating mortality events. Despite this, widespread drought-induced mortality has already been observed across the tropics for specific tree groups [@Bennett:2015; @Chitra-Tarak.2018; @Hilker:2014; @Phillips:2010] and tropical mortality rates are increasing in some regions [@Brienen.2015; @Hubau.2020]. However, state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) fail to capture drought-induced vegetation dynamics in the tropics [@Galbraith.2010; @Powell:2013], as underlying mechanisms of drought-tolerance are not fully understood or quantified.

\
Among all the mechanisms plants employ to deal with drought, deep water access is arguably the most commonly invoked, but under-studied mechanism. This mechanism assumes that water availability varies below-ground by vertical depth and so do rooting depths of co-occurring trees, by species and size [@Meinzer:1999; @Chitra-Tarak.2018]. Consequently, trees in the same forest differ in their drought experience, and thus in their growth and mortality responses. A key bottleneck in community-wide testing of this mechanism has been lack of data on trees' rooting or water-sourcing depths, followed by data on water-availability at those depths. A recent meta-analysis documented maximum rooting depths for 318 tree species, that is, less than 0.5% of the world’s 60 thousand tree species [@Fan:2017; @Beech:2017]. Further, only a small fraction of those are tropical, even though ~70-90 % (40 - 53 thousand species) of the world’s tree diversity resides in the tropics [@Slik:2015]. Use of stable isotopes of water as a tracer provides an indirect measure of water sourcing depths by matching isotopic value in plant tissue to variations in soil pore water with depth. However, such data are extremely rare [@Evaristo:2016]. In general, community-scale data collection for rooting or water-sourcing depths is especially challenging for species-rich tropical forests. 

\
Trade-offs shape how plants make a living in their environment (ecological strategies) and also provide the essential constraints to model species-rich communities under a changing environment [@Koven:2020; @Christoffersen:2016kd2d; @Wright:2010]. This entails identifying trade-offs among environment, traits and demography. Specifically for the water environment (or, resource), observations of individual trade-offs between environment-trait, trait-trait and trait-demography has identified an acquisitive-conservative resource economic spectrum similar to those for light and nutrients, although, for water, examples of all trade-offs observed simultaneously are rare, and below-ground traits or environment linkages are weak [@Reich:2014; @Sterck:2011]. Acquisitive species have traits with high capacity to acquire, move, store and use water (high $K_{max}$, low wood density; see Table 1 for trait symbols and their definitions) and achieve high growth potential, but build flimsy, disposable tissues (high SLA) and are less tolerant of low resource availablity, whereas species with conservative traits are better protected from carbon losses and are more drought tolerant (low $\Psi_{50}$, low $\Psi_{tlp}$, larger safety margin). Acquisitive species are spatially associated with wet sites (high resource) such as valleys or those with high rainfall [@Kursar:2009; @Oliveira:2019], but whether and how the acquisitive-conservative spectrum holds true for the water dynamics vertically below-ground is not clear. Deep rooting may be expected to support an acquisitive strategy with a steady water supply unlike shallow-rooted trees. However, this may depend on the exact dynamics of water-availability by depth at a site, depending on precipitation regime and hydrology. In pulse-driven systems *shallow*-rooted plants are associated with acquisitive traits (high $K_{max}$) that maximise the use of the water-pulse, while *deep*-rooted plants show conservative traits (cavitation-resistant xylem, osmoregulation) [@Schwinning:2013 and references therein]. 

\
Significant efforts have been invested into identifying and linking universal drought indices, above-ground traits, and demographic rates. These efforts have resulted in identification of above-ground traits such as proxies of hydraulic failure as indicators of mortality risk. While correlations between aboveground hydraulic traits and mortality have been identified [@Anderegg:2016], numerous counter examples also exist [@Hoffmann.2011; @Johnson:2018fad; @Nardini:2015; @Paddock:2013]. However, plants' realized water environments, specifically their ability to acquire water via differing rooting depths, are rarely studied, especially in the tropical region. To better understand how below-ground rooting depth is linked to above-ground hydraulic traits and mortality for co-occurring tropical forest tree species, we make a thorough assessment for a tropical forest of trade-offs between the below-ground water environment, above-ground hydraulic traits, estimates of effective rooting depths and demographic outcomes over 35 years that witnessed droughts of various intensity and duration. Specifically, we test an overarching hypothesis that inter-specific variation in trees' effective rooting depths aligns species on an acquisitive-conservative economic spectrum optimized for increasingly reliable water availability by depth. Our hypotheses are that (i) trees with deeper ERD have hydraulic traits associated with rapid water transport but cavitation-vulnerable xylem: higher maximum stem hydraulic conductivity ($K_{max}$), but greater xylem vulnerability to embolism ($\Psi_{88,~stem}$), higher $\Psi_{tlp}$ and narrower hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$), whereas shallower ERD species are associated with less efficient but safer hydraulic traits; and that, (ii) deeper ERD species have lower mortality rates due to low realized risk of hydraulic failure, whereas shallower ERD species may have higher mortality rates as a result of higher variability in shallow soil water availability. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a mechanistic link between trees' realized drought experience, above-ground hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes for a species-rich forest.

# Materials and Methods
\
In the following sections we describe the study site, the models and data used to estimate and evaluate (1) soil water potential dynamics by depth in the whole-soil column, (2) species-specific leaf vulnerability curves, and (3) species-specific effective rooting depths. These are followed by analyses to address the proposed hypotheses. Note that only new data on leaf vulnerability curves collected during this study are described below, details of all other datasets used are described in the Supplementary Information.

\
In summary, we obtained daily dynamics of plant water potential ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) by depth $z$ in the whole-soil column with a locally parameterized and calibrated 1-D hydrological water balance model. We developed a novel inverse model to estimate species effective rooting depths (ERD), defined as the depth ($z$) at which soil water dynamics ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) best explained observed dynamics of species growth (six 5-yearly censuses, 1990-2015). This model incorporated impact of atmospheric drought (VPD) on growth and was constrained by above-ground hydraulic traits, namely, species leaf vulnerability curves ($K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$). We collected new data on vulnerability curves for 21 species. Identifying scaling relationships between these curves and commonly available traits (Leaf Mass Area~lamina~, Wood Specific Gravity~100^$\circ$^C~; see Table \@ref(tab:symbols) for definitions) allowed us to scale-up these curves to `r length(data.model.AB$sp)` tree species in the community (of 321 total). We evaluated ERD against existing data on plant and soil water isotopes ($\delta^2H$) and tested coordination of ERD with hydraulic traits and mortality rates.

## Study Site Description
\
We conducted this study at the seasonally dry tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, given its extensive characterization in terms of long-term forest demography, plant functional ecology, hydrology, and data on stable water isotopes on tree species and soil from an independent study on trees’ water-sourcing depths [@Meinzer:1999]. The 1,560ha island was formed after the river Chagres was dammed in 1914 to create Gatun Lake and complete the Panama Canal. Rainfall at BCI is seasonal with a mean annual rainfall of `r round(rain.man.stats$rain)` mm ($\pm$ `r round(rain.man.stats$rain.sd)` SD; `r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`) and a four-month long dry season from mid-December through mid-April ($\le$ 100 mm rain month^-1^). The entire island is forested and classified as a tropical moist forest in the Holdridge Life Zone system. Although 28% of canopy tree species are at least partly deciduous during the dry season, the maximum percentage of deciduous individuals in the canopy is only 6.3%, and the percentage of crown area that is deciduous is estimated at 9.7% [@Condit:2000]. Long-term hydrological monitoring at BCI began in 1972, while demographical monitoring began with the 50 ha ForestGEO plot establishment in 1981-82 [@Condit.1998uq; @Hubbell:1999; @Anderson-Teixeira:2014].

\
In the 50 ha plot all stems above 10 mm diameter at breast height (dbh) are mapped, tagged with a unique number, identified to species level and measured every 5 years through 1985-2015 for growth, mortality as well as recruitment of new stems into the 10 mm size class [@Condit.2017]. This inventory represents 321 woody species across the eight censuses. Aside from a 2ha patch of ~100-year-old secondary forest at the north-eastern corner of the plot the remaining 48ha represent old growth forest that was never clear cut for agriculture. The plot (1000 m x 500 m) was originally chosen for its relative uniformity of relief and other physical conditions; the elevation range is only 40 m (120-160 m) [@Harms:2001]. The plot is situated in the Conrad catchment. Soils of the plot are homogeneous with red light clays, described as the Ava soil type, accounting for 72.4% of the plot [@Baillie.2017]. The topsoil field texture is silty clay loam that gradually fines to silty clay in the subsoil. Soil is mostly free draining, but restricted subsoil permeability gives rise to temporary wet season ponding. Detailed descriptions of the climate, geology, flora and fauna of BCI can be found elsewhere [@Croat.1978; @Leigh.1982; @Gentry.1990].

## Model ELM-FATES for Soil Matric Potentials

### Model description
\
To estimate dynamics of water availability by depth over the forest’s rooting zone, we implemented a 1-D hydrological model, the Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model (ELM), coupled with the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) (hereafter, ELM-FATES). FATES is a state-of-the-art, community-based, open-source model used for studying climate-vegetation interactions. FATES is a next generation vegetation dynamics model for ELM, with a size-structured group of plants (cohorts) and successional trajectory-based patches based on the ecosystem demography approach [@Moorcroft.2001]. FATES couples to ELM by a common interface of water and carbon fluxes. Detailed descriptions for ELM and FATES can be found elsewhere [@Koven:2020; @Fisher:2014; @Bonan:2013].

\
Below we describe an equation of water balance in ELM-FATES that is most relevant for our study site, even though ELM-FATES is capable of incorporating numerous other hydrological processes relevant for wetlands and lakes and snow [@Bonan:2013]. ELM-FATES parameterizes interception, throughfall, canopy drip, infiltration, evaporation, surface runoff, subsurface drainage, redistribution within the soil column, and groundwater discharge and recharge so as to simulate changes in canopy water $\Delta W_{can}$, surface water $\Delta W_{sfc}$, soil water $\Delta W_{liq, z}$, and water in an unconfined aquifer $\Delta W_{a}$ (omitting processes relevant to snow, wetlands or lakes). The equation can be described as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta W_{can} + \Delta W_{sfc} + \sum_{z=1}^{15} \Delta W_{liq,z} + \Delta W_{a} = \left(q_{rain} - E_{v} - E_{g} - q_{over} - q_{h2osfc} - q_{drai}\right)\Delta t
\end{split}
(\#eq:water-balance)
\end{equation}

where, $q_{rain}$ is rainfall, $E_{v}$ is evapotranspiration (ET) of the forest, $E_{g}$ is ground evaporation, $q_{over}$ is surface runoff, $q_{h2osfc}$ is runoff from surface water storage, $q_{drai}$ is sub-surface drainage (all in mm H~2~O) and $\Delta t$ is the time-step. $z$ represents the depths of 15 exponentially distributed soil layers: $\simeq$ 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.21, 0.37, 0.62, 1, 1.7, 2.9, 4.7, 7.8, 13, 21 and 35 (m).

### Model parameterization
\
To parameterize the model, we identified eleven parameters relevant for Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), determined their ranges based on literature for the study site or for the tropics (Table \@ref(tab:param)), and sampled 5000 ensembles from this global parameter space with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). In the Conrad catchment existing data on soil hydraulic conductivity for the depths of 12.5 and 60 cm showed a decline by depth (@Kinner:2004; Table \@ref(tab:param)). We generated 5000 LHS samples within the 95% CI for the two depths and assumed a linear decline between each paired sample, while for depths < 12.5 cm and > 60 cm, we assumed the same value as that for depths 12.5 and 60 cm, respectively (Fig. S\@ref(fig:ksat-profiles) [Need to fix SI Figs. numbering to begin at 1]). For all runs, instead of ELM's default soil texture-based soil water retention curve, we used a curve that we derived using existing data on gravimetric water content vs. $\Psi_{soil}$ for depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m [@Kupers:2019]. We converted gravimetric water content to volumetric (VWC, $\theta$) using a bulk density value of of 0.8 g cm^-3^ measured at a point location (see below). A @Campbell.1974 empirical equation was fitted for all depths pooled together, as exploratory analyses indicated differences among depths were nominal,

\begin{equation}
\Psi_{soil} = \Psi_e\left(\frac{\theta}{\theta_{s}}\right)^{-b}
(\#eq:soil-ret-curve)
\end{equation}
where $\Psi_e$ is the air-entry matric potential (200, mm H~2~O), $\theta_{s}$ is the saturated volumetric water content (0.51, cm^3^ cm^-3^), and $b$, an index for soil pore-size distribution (10, unitless), respectively.

\
We ran ELM-FATES for the 5000 parameter ensembles with hourly climate drivers from 1985-2018 [@Faybishenko.2020] initialized with the stand structure of the 50 ha plot [@Condit.2019a] in a single site mode ($0.1^\circ$ x $0.1^\circ$ centered at $9.1530^\circ$N, $280.2539^\circ$E). As our key interest here was in soil water availability rather than forest dynamics, we ran ELM-FATES in a lower-complexity configuration: static stand structure, and with a single plant functional type (PFT) of evergreen trees. The latter was chosen as only 9.7% of BCI crown area is dry-season deciduous and addition of dry-deciduous PFT did not significantly alter results (not shown). Holding the stand structure static rather than allowing it to emerge from physiologically-mediated competition between trees removes a set of internal model feedbacks and thus enables a cleaner experimental design where the only differences between model simulations are the direct physiological effects of perturbed model parameters. 

### Model evaluation
\
We calibrated the model over 2012-2018 against three key fluxes in Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), namely, (i) evapotranspiration ($ET \simeq E_{v} + E_{g}$) from the eddy flux tower (2012-2017; see [SI](#SIData)), (ii) stream discharge for the Conrad Catchment ($q_{run} \simeq q_{over} + q_{drai}$; 2012-2018) and (iii) soil volumetric water content (VWC, $\theta_{z} \simeq W_{liq, z}$; 2012-2018). We collected VWC data (2012-2018) from a point location at the eddy flux tower with a vertical time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe ($\theta_{0-0.15 m}$). This data was calibrated based on measurements of gravimetric soil moisture at the vertical probe (0-15 cm) on several occasions (Fig. S\@ref(fig:TDR-calib)) and mean bulk dry density of 0.8 g cm^-3^ (*n* = 5, cylinder volume = 1250 cm^3^). We also leveraged existing opportunistic dry season gravimetric measurements by depth for the entire 50-ha plot, converted to VWC units assuming a bulk density of 0.8 g cm^-3^ ($\theta_{0.15 m}$, $\theta_{0.4m}$ and $\theta_{1 m}$ in 2015 and $\theta_{0.15m}$, $\theta_{0.4m}$ in 2016; @Kupers:2019). Beginning in 2016 we additionally installed three horizontal probes at depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m and we applied the same calibration equation to these data as that for the vertical probe. However, for VWC calibration we used data from only the vertical TDR probe ($\theta_{0-0.15 m}$) to capture the long-term dynamics and the plot-wide measurements to capture the dynamics by depth. Here, in general, our interest was to capture the soil moisture dynamics by depth, so we performed model calibration in a two step process: first, we prioritized model fit with $\theta_{0.1m}$. We chose ensembles that minimized root mean square error (RMSE) between $\theta_{0.1m}$ and W~liq,`r soil.depths[8]`m~ (~300 ensembles with standaridised RMSE (range 0-1) across ensembles < 0.2). Second, we calculated an objective function for each of the 5000 ensembles by equally weighing standardized RMSE between observations and simulations across all fluxes, and chose 100 ensembles, within the 300 that best-fit $\theta_{0-0.15 m}$, that had the lowest values of the objective function. Let $f(obs,~sim)$ be RMSE between observations and simulations standardized across ensembles (range 0-1), based on monthly sums for $ET$ and $q_{run}$, respectively, and daily averages for $\theta$s, then the objective function ($\overline{O}$) can be described as

\begin{equation}
\overline{O} = \frac{1}{6}\sum \left(f(ET,~E_{v} + E_{g}) + f(q_{run},~q_{over} + q_{drai}) + f(\theta_{0-0.15m}, {W_{liq,~\overline{z}}}) + f(\theta_{0.15m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[4]`m}) + f(\theta_{0.4m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[6]`m}) + f(\theta_{1 m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[8]`m})\right)
(\#eq:obj-func)
\end{equation}

where $W_{liq,~\overline{z}}$ is the daily average of $W_{liq,~z}$ for $z$ = `r paste(soil.depths[1:4], collapse=", ")` m. See Table \@ref(tab:param) for the range of best-fit values for different parameters. We ran ELM-FATES with the chosen 100 ensembles from 1985-2018, with first 5 years used for model spin-up.

## Leaf Vulnerability Curves
\
We measured ($K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$) on adult trees of `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)` common species (see [SI](#SIData)). We fitted four different functions to species-specific data using the *anneal* optimization function with the package likelihood in R: exponential without an intercept ($K_{leaf} = Ae^{-B\Psi_{leaf}}$), exponential with an intercept ($K_{leaf} = C + Ae^{-B\Psi_{leaf}}$), logistic ($K_{leaf} = \frac{A}{1 + \left(\frac{\Psi_{leaf}}{x_{0}}\right)^B}$) and sigmoidal ($K_{leaf} = \frac{A}{1 + e^{-\left(\frac{\Psi_{leaf} - x_{0}}{B}\right)}}$) [@Guyot:2011]. The differences among AICc values for these functions were not large within species (Zailaa et al. to be submitted). We chose the exponential function without the intercept to fit observed data across species, and as a general function to scale-up to the community, because it had the lowest AICc for most species, captured the form of the observed data across all species well, and had the lowest number of parameters, that is, two:

\begin{equation}
K_{leaf} = Ae^{-B\Psi_{leaf}} + error
(\#eq:vc-exp)
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are fitted species-specific parameters. From these fits we estimated species $K_{max,~leaf}$, $\Psi_{50,~leaf}$ and  $\Psi_{80,~leaf}$ (see Table 1). We identified scaling relationships between fitted parameters $A$ and $B$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) and two traits that were available at the community-scale, namely,  WSG and LMA (@Wright:2010; see SI for description of how data gaps were filled. We fitted polynomial equations described as,

\begin{equation}
A = `r acf[1]` `r acf[2]`WSG `r acf[3]`WSG^2 + `r acf[4]`WSGB + `r acf[5]`B `r acf.6`B^2 + error
(\#eq:a-mod)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B = `r bcf[1]` `r bcf[2]`B + `r bcf[3]`B^2 + `r bcf[4]`BLMA + `r bcf[5]`LMA `r bcf[6]`LMA^2 + error
(\#eq:b-mod)
\end{equation}

As these fits explained large proportion of variation in parameters $A$ and $B$ (see results), we sequentially used Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod) and \@ref(eq:a-mod) to predict parameters $B$ and $A$, respectively, for the `r length(unique(bci.AB$sp[!is.na(bci.AB$A)]))` species for which WSG and LMA were both available, retained `r length(unique(data.model.AB$sp))` for which parameters $A$ and $B$ were both positive, and fitted vulnerability curves to those.

## Model for Effective Rooting Depths (ERD)
\
Water is a key limiting resource for tree growth. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and water supply as determined by soil moisture are factors known to influence water uptake [@Lawrence.2019]. In this study, we used leaf conductivity ($K_{leaf}$) determined by rhizosphere soil water potential ($\Psi_{soil}$) as an approximation of the soil water limiting factor. For dry-deciduous species seasonality in leaf cover may also influence plant water uptake. We therefore tested alternate models of growth, aka inverse models for ERD (Eqs. \@ref(eq:M2)-\@ref(eq:M6)), in which a species' growth dynamics across census intervals was regressed against census interval means of multiplied or additive effects of one or more factors calculated daily: VPD, $K_{leaf}$ and the fraction of leaf cover (all standardized to range from 0-1; see below). Let n~t~ be the total number of days in census interval $t$, then for individual tree species Growth~t~ and depth $z$ these models are described as follows:

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} + error
(\#eq:M1)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} StdVPD_{n} + error
(\#eq:M2)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} + StdVPD_{n} + error
(\#eq:M3)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} LeafCover_{doy} + error
(\#eq:M4)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n}StdVPD_{n}LeafCover_{doy} + error
(\#eq:M5)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} (StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} + StdVPD_{n}) LeafCover_{doy} + error
(\#eq:M6)
\end{equation}
We estimated daily value of $K_{leaf,z,n}$ by substituting $\Psi_{soil,~z,~n}$ in the leaf vulnerability curves Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) as:

\begin{equation}
K_{leaf,~z,~n} = Ae^{-B\Psi_{soil,~z,~n}}
(\#eq:k-soil)
\end{equation}

We estimated species effective rooting depths (ERD), defined as the depth ($z$) at which soil water dynamics ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) best explained observed dynamics of species growth (six 5-yearly censuses, 1990-2015; see below).

### Model parameterization
\
For growth estimates, to minimize the effect of light variation among trees, we selected only large trees ($\ge$ 30 cm dbh, the diameter at breast height) and species whose maximum height was $\ge$ 30 m (hereafter, canopy species) and thus are likely to be fully exposed to the sun. We selected trees for which the height of the diameter measurements were unchanged across all censuses (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015). For each individual tree (*i*), we calculated growth rates ($Gr_{i,t}$; cm yr^-1^) for each of the five census intervals ($t$) as the difference between tree dbh measured in successive censuses, divided by the inter-census interval based on the exact date of measurements. We eliminated positive outliers as any growth rates amounting to > 75 mm yr^-1^, as this was the highest rate observed with confidence for fastest growing species [@Condit.2017]. Negative outliers were removed based on known measurement error, $\sigma_{e} = 0.006214d + 0.903$, where *d* is dbh. Any stem whose later dbh measurement fell < 4$\sigma_{e}$ the earlier measurement was removed [@Condit.2017]. As tree growth rates vary with size [@Muller-Landau:2006], to keep growth rates comparable across census intervals, we obtained residuals from a dbh model of tree growth based on a tree's dbh at the beginning of a census interval ($Resid_{i,t} = Gr_{i,t} - f(d_{i, t})$). The diameter model of growth ($f(d_{i, t})$), a B-spline based polynomial equation with 5 degrees of freedom, was fitted to growth rates from all trees pooled together as there was insufficient species-specific data for large trees (Fig. S\@ref(fig:dbh-model)). We retained only those trees that had $Resid_{i,t}$ estimates for all census intervals (total trees = `r sum(g.n$n)`) and standardized (centered and scaled) individual tree time series of $Resid_{i,t}$. We then obtained `r length(erd.sp)` species-level time-series of medians of $Resid_{i,t}$ ($Growth_{t}$). These were obtained for only those species with complete records on at least three trees (median *n* = `r median(g.n$n)`, max *n* = `r max(g.n$n)` trees per species).

\
There are many factors that could affect plant growth, including soil moisture, VPD, leaf area, temperature and radiation. Based on our preliminary analyses, incorporation of temperature and radiation did not improve our model fitting, thus we mainly focused on the impact of soil moisture, VPD and leaf area in our models.

As VPD may have a non-linear relationship with growth, we fitted a polynomial curve between mean daily values by month of gross primary productivity (gC m^2^ day^-1^) we collected from the eddy flux tower located 75 m from the 50-ha plot and VPD (kPa; $\overline{GPP} = `r vpd.cf[1]` + `r vpd.cf[2]`VPD + `r vpd.cf[3]`VPD^2 + error = StdVPD$; 2012-2017; Fig. S\@ref(fig:gpp-vpd)) and used standardized $\overline{GPP}$ to represent the impact of VPD on growth (hereafter, $StdVPD$; range 0-1) in Eqs. \@ref(eq:M2), \@ref(eq:M3), \@ref(eq:M5) and \@ref(eq:M6). Due to the coincidence of higher temperature, higher radiation, and lower humidity during the dry season at our study site, the impact of VPD may as well be a combined impact of temperature, humidity, and radiation.

\
To explore the effect of species seasonality in leaf cover on growth, we assumed of species-specific seasonal curves for Leaf Cover Fraction ($LeafCover$, range 0-1, unitless). For evergreen species we assumed $LeafCover$ = 1 throughout the year, whereas for non-evergreen species (various deciduous classes), we assumed $LeafCover$ = 1 during the wet season (DOY = 150 to 300) given the high forest-level leaf area index for this period (not shown), and obtained an estimate of $LeafCover$ for the rest of the year as follows. We interpolated species-specific weekly leaf-fall data collected at two similar sites in BCI (1985-2020) to a daily estimate, scaled to express daily leaf fall as a fraction of the total leaf fall in a given year and obtained an average leaf fall fraction by DOY estimate across years ($LeafFall$, range 0-1, unitless). Thus for non-evergreen species, we cumulatively deducted $LeafFall$ from $LeafCover$ = 1 beginning DOY = 300 and obtained a $LeafCover$ by DOY curve (Fig. S\@ref(fig:leaf-cover)). We obtained species-specific parameters $A$ & $B$ for Eq. \@ref(eq:k-soil) either from data when available, or a model based on $LMA$ or $WSG$ as described in the earlier section, and used standardized K within species ($Std.K$; range 0-1) in Eqs. \@ref(eq:M1)-\@ref(eq:M6).

\
For the combination of each model \@ref(eq:M1)-\@ref(eq:M6), species and 100 hydrological realizations, we obtained AIC, goodness-of-fit (*R*^2^) and Pearson's $\rho$ for each soil depth $z$. For each combination of model-species-hydrological realization we retained only one depth with the least AIC score (the best-fit), and within those depths retained the ones that had a positive corresponding Pearson's $\rho$ and *R*^2^ >= 0.5 as a valid set. For each model-species combination, we defined effective rooting depth (ERD) as the median of these subset of depths and calculated standard error.

### Model evaluation
\
For each model, species ERD was regressed against species xylem sap $\delta^2H$ (permil; *n* = 7). We used xylem sap $\delta^2H$ values given in @Meinzer:2001 for the dry-season of March 1997 as these showed largest seasonal divergence among species, with a corresponding gradient of $\delta^2H$ in the soil (Fig. S\@ref(fig:iso-data)). We removed species that are likely to be deciduous in March as xylem sap $\delta^2H$ of these species may not be linked with water sourced at the time of measurement and thus may not be comparable with other species that had leaves. We also removed *G. standleyana*, whose xylem sap isotope value was not well constrained by the soil water isotope depth profile.

## ERD Coordination with Above-ground Hydraulic Traits
\
To evaluate whether ERD was associated with above-ground hydraulic traits (*n* = 8 species with both datasets), we regressed species ERD with maximum stem hydraulic conductance ($K_{max, stem}$), leaf turgor loss point ($\Psi_{tlp}$), vulnerability to embolism from cavitation measured in terms of pressure at which 88% of stem hydraulic conductivity is lost ($\Psi_{88,~stem}$), and hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$). See [SI](#SIData) for data collection and estimation of these variables (RCT:"Brett, please add a section").

## Mortality Analyses and Extreme Drought Experience
\
We calculated mortality rates for large trees ($\ge$ 10 cm dbh) of species with ERD estimates (all canopy species with maximum height $\ge$ 30 m) and average abundance of at least 20 trees (one species with an average abundance of 9 trees was eliminated; *n* = `r length(erd.mrate.sp)`). For each of the seven census intervals ($t$) in the 35-yr record (1982, 1985, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2015), species $Mort_{t}$ (% yr^-1^) for two successive censuses (cen~1~ and cen~2~) was calculated as $Mort_{t} = \frac{D_{cen_{2}}}{N_{cen_{1}}}.\frac{100}{time}$, where $N_{cen_{1}}$ and $D_{cen_{1}}$ are the total number of trees of a species present in cen~1~ and dead in cen~2~, respectively, in the 50 ha plot and $time$ is the duration based on mean dates of cen~1~ and cen~2~. For each species we calculated mean mortality rate across all intervals as $Mort_{mean} = \frac{1}{6}\sum_{t=1}^{6} {Mort_{t}}$. To test whether ERD plays a role in alleviating mortality risk, we regressed species ERD against species ($Mort_{mean}$). To assess whether this may be due to deeper ERD species escaping the experience of catastrophic soil drought, we calculated the proportion of days over the $\Psi_{soil,~z}$ simulation period (1990-2015) for which soil water potential in the soil zone matching species ERD ($\Psi_{soil,~z = ERD}$) were below species $\Psi_{crit}$, which was defined as $\Psi_{50,~leaf}$.

\
All statistical analyses were done in R statistical environment (version 3.5.3, @R:2019).

# Results
## Soil Water Dynamics By Depth
\
The ELM-FATES simulations with the chosen best-fit parameter ensembles (Table \@ref(tab:param)) successfully captured the dynamics of soil moisture by depth (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)A & Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)B), including the observations from the horizontal TDR probes that were not included in the calibration. These simulations also simultaneously captured the dynamics in stream discharge (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)C) and evapotranspiration (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)D). The reduction in parameter range in the best-fit ensembles compared to the global ranges tested showed that the above calibration was sensitive to the following parameters: the Ball-Berry stomatal slope parameter, the ELM rooting distribution parameter that regulates the depth of the rooting profile, soil hydraulic conductivity profile especially at depth, and our adjustment factor to soil hydraulic conductivity to account for macroporosity and direct flow paths (Table \@ref(tab:param)). Soil Water Potential dynamics ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) by depth (z = 0.1 through 13) obtained from the best-fit simulations revealed that census intervals varied in soil droughts in terms of intensity at depth, seasonality and duration (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-droughts)). Nevertheless, across the simulation period (1990-2015) $\Psi_{soil,~z}$ remained above -0.5 MPa from depths 1.7 to 13 m (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-all-depths)).

## Leaf Vulnerability Curves
\
For the leaf vulnerability curve parameters $A$ & $B$ fitted to the observed data on $K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$, $WSG$ & parameter $B$ explained a large proportion of variation in parameter $A$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:a-mod); *Adj. R*^2^ = `r afit.r2`; *P* `r  afit.p`; also see Fig. S\@ref(fig:ab-fit)). $WSG$ & $LMA$ explained a large proportion of variation in parameter $B$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod); Adj. *R*^2^ = `r bfit.r2`; *P* `r  bfit.p`). WSG alone explained `r round(a.wsg.r2*100,0)` % of variation in $A$ ($A = `r a.wsg.cf[1]` `r a.wsg.cf[2]`B + `r a.wsg.cf[3]`B^2 + error$; *P* `r  a.wsg.p`) and `r round(b.wsg.r2*100,0)` % of variation in $B$ ($B = `r b.wsg.cf[1]` `r b.wsg.cf[2]`B + `r b.wsg.cf[3]`B^2 + error$; *P* `r  b.wsg.p`). Parameter $B$ alone explained `r round(a.b.r2*100,0)` % of variation in $A$ (*P* `r  a.b.p`), while $LMA$ alone was weakly related to $A$ and was not related to $B$ (not shown). Leaf vulnerability curves fitted to observed data on `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)` species as well as percent loss of conuctivity curves are shown in Fig. S\@ref(fig:obs-plc-curves). Vulnerability curves were predicted using Eqs. \@ref(eq:a-mod)-\@ref(eq:b-mod) for `r sp.n.model` species for which such curves were unavailable (out of `r length(unique(erd.iso$sp))` species for which ERD was determined (Fig.  S\@ref(fig:obs-comm-plc-curves). 


## Effective Rooting Depths, Vulnerability to Embolism and Hydraulic Safety Margins
\
In comparison to the measured isotopic signal ($\delta^2H$), our results showed that the ERD model with a multiplicative effect of VPD and without Leaf Cover (Eq. \@ref(eq:M2)) had highest goodness-of-fit (*R*^2^ = 0.85; *P* = 0.008; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-iso)). All the other ERD models showed a positive but non-significant relationship with $\delta^2H$ (Fig. S\@ref(fig:other-erd-mods)). The model with an additive effect of VPD and those with Leaf Cover had only three-to-four species with sufficient species-level goodness-of-fit (Eqs. \@ref(eq:M3)-\@ref(eq:M6)) versus six for models without (Eqs. \@ref(eq:M1)-\@ref(eq:M2)). For the rest of the analyses we therefore used species ERD estimates from the model with a multiplicative effect of VPD, without Leaf Cover (Eq. \@ref(eq:M2)). Notably, two species, *L. seemannii* and *T. tuberculata*, that @Meinzer:1999 found to have xylem sap $\delta^2H$ values between soil water and groundwater, suggesting that these species sourced most of the water from depths > 1 m, were also identified by our model with ERD > 1 m (2.9 m for both species; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-iso)).

In this forest modeled effective rooting depths (ERD) for the `r length(erd.sp)` large, canopy tree species varied from `r min(df.erd.to.plot$depth)` m to `r max(df.erd.to.plot$depth)` m (Fig. \@ref(fig:sp-erd)). For the subset of species for which hydraulic properties were available, species with deeper ERD showed greater maximum stem hydraulic conductance ($K_{max,~stem}$, *R*^2^ = 0.39, *P* = 0.098, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)A), less negative leaf $\Psi_{tlp}$ (*R*^2^ = 0.6, p = 0.024, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)B), less negative $\Psi_{88,~stem}$ and thus greater vulnerability to embolism from cavitation (*R*^2^ = 0.72, p = 0.007, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)C), and narrower hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$; *R*^2^ = 0.74, p = 0.013, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)D).

## Effective Rooting Depths, Experienced Drought and Mortality
\
Species with deeper ERD showed lower mean mortality rates across the 34-yr record (1982-2015; *R*^2^ = 0.11, *P* = 0.075, *n* = `r length(erd.mrate.sp)`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-mort)). For five out of seven census intervals, species with shallower ERD had significantly higher mortality anomalies than deeper ERD species (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-mort-census)). Analysis of time spent under catastrophic soil drought showed that the proportion of days species $\Psi_{ERD}$ was more negative than species $\Psi_{crit}$ decreased with species ERD (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-time)). Species with ERD deeper than 1 m did not cross species $\Psi_{crit}$ for the entire 25-yr period for which soil water potential $\Psi_{soil,~z}$ was modeled (1990-2015), as soil depths below 1 m remained above `r round(psi.1.7.min$median, 2)` MPa (`r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q97.5), 2)`, `r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q2.5), 2)`;  median, 95% CI) through all the dry seasons and drought periods, which is above ($\Psi_{crit}$) of the most sensitive tree species (-0.28 MPa).

# Discussion
\
Our analyses revealed that co-occurring large canopy tree species (*n* = `r length(erd.sp)`) with deeper effective rooting depths (ERD) were associated with higher hydraulic efficiency, but not safety. Deep ERD species showed higher maximum stem hydraulic conductance, but greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower hydraulic safety margins compared to shallow ERD species. This trade-off translated into greater drought tolerance, as deeper ERD species showed lower mortality rates than shallower ERD species over the 35-yr record (1982-2015). Analysis of time spent below ($\Psi_{crit}$) in the soil zone matching ERD $\Psi_{soil,~z = ERD}$ showed that this was likely due to decreasing realized risk of hydraulic failure with increasing rooting depth. We thus show, for the first time, that inter-specific variation in trees' effective rooting depths aligns species on a conservative-acquisitive water economic spectrum by demonstrating a link between trees' realized drought experience, hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes. On the acquisitive end of the spectrum were deep ERD species with a  hydraulically efficient, but risky, suite of traits optimized for an environment of reliable and abundant source of water at depth that resulted in a lower mortality risk. At the conservative end of the spectrum were shallow ERD species with inefficient, but safer, xylem likely optimized for high variability in $\Psi_{soil}$ in the shallow soil layers, and resulting in higher variance in mortality rates across censuses as $\Psi_{soil,~z = ERD}$ crossed ERD $\Psi_{crit}$. Mortality rates of shallow ERD species may have been exacerbated by increased drought events during the study period. @Condit.2017 showed that half of the extreme dry seasons (< 1 SD annual water deficit) during 1931-2015 (85-yr) occurred during 1982-2005 (24-yr) of the 34-yr long study period (1982-2015).

### Realised drought risk integral to assessing drought-vulnerability
\
Our study brings attention to the need for assessing drought-sensitivity in terms of species realized drought risk. We found that species accessing deeper water had greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower branch hydraulic safety margins, that is, traits that are commonly identified as proxies for mortality risk, but they were less droughted and had lower mortality compared to species relying on shallower water through a study period of greater recurrence of drought. These results are consistent with the rare studies that included three or four species each with known rooting or water sourcing depths and assessed their hydraulic traits and mortality rates during extreme droughts [@Johnson:2018fad; @Nardini:2015]. @Johnson:2018fad found that mortality decreased with deep rooting even though deep rooted species were more vulnerable to xylem cavitation (high $\Psi_{88,~stem}$) and had narrower safety-margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$). @Nardini:2015 found that a species sourcing deep water in a Karst system showed lower hydraulic failure and mortality in an extreme drought despite having high $\Psi_{88,~stem}$ and narrower safety margin compared to two species sourcing shallow-water.

\
Our result of lower mortality in deep rooted trees contrasts with the finding of @Chitra-Tarak.2018 in which species identified by their inverse ERD model as effectively deep rooted died *more* in a prolonged, extreme drought. Their hydrological model revealed that the multi-annual drought exhausted the deep water reservoir for over two years, whereas our hydrological modeling at BCI finds that despite higher frequency of droughts during our study period, $\Psi_{soil}$ remained above `r round(psi.1.7.min$median, 2)` (`r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q97.5), 2)`, `r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q2.5), 2)`; median, 95% CI) below the depth of 1 m through all the dryseasons and drought periods, that is above ($\Psi_{crit}$) of the most sensitive tree species (-0.28 MPa). The difference in our results are likely attributable to site differences in the precipitation regime. In their dry forest site (Mudumalai National Park, India) precipitation is low: 1095 $\pm$ 296 mm (mean $\pm$ SD) compared to `r round(rain.man.stats$rain)` $\pm$ `r round(rain.man.stats$rain.sd)` mm (`r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`) at BCI, and precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratio at Mudumalai is nearly one (Penman-Monteith PET = 980 $\pm$ 64 mm), whereas at BCI it is nearly two (Penman-Monteith PET = `r round(mean(clim$pet.PM))` $\pm$ `r round(sd(clim$pet.PM))` mm;`r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`; this study, @Guo.2016), and thus at BCI deep soil layers are effectively recharged annually (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-all-depths); @Chitra-Tarak.2018). The variation in mortality explained by ERD in our study is low (*R*^2^ = 0.11, *P* = 0.075), and other causes may explain observed mortality [@McDowell.2018]. 

### Effective rooting depths at the tree community level
\
By estimating ERD for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` canopy tree species, we make an important advance in modeling effective rooting depths at the community level in species species-rich tropical forests. Our chosen ERD model is an advance over the only other inverse model of ERD (@Chitra-Tarak.2018; *n* = 12 species) in terms of physiologically meaningful representation, fewer parameters and corroboration with tree and soil data on $\delta^2H$. The model in @Chitra-Tarak.2018 estimated six species-specific phenomenological parameters: three as root fraction for corresponding lumped vadose zone layers, and three as shape parameters for water uptake vs availability curves. For each species, they calculated daily water uptake successively from three layers, that is, the supply, to satisfy the demand of the daily maximum evapotranspiration, a function of PET and LAI. They regressed total supply to total demand ratio over census intervals as a growth coefficient against growth (five data points), and chose values for six parameters that best-fit (highest *R*^2^, that is, two additional parameters). Our inverse ERD model fits only two parameters by way of regressing depth-specific model against five growth data points. Our model was constrained on VPD and species leaf vulnerability curves, variables that are shown to be physiologically meaningful.

\
We benefited from finding a strong scaling relationship between commonly collected 'soft' traits at the community scale (LMA and WSG) and parameters of leaf vulnerability (or percent loss of conductance, (PLC)) curves for which we collected data on a few species (*n* = `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)`), a 'hard' trait. This allowed us to scale-up the leaf vulnerability curves at the community scale (*n* = `r length(ab.table$Species)` species, see Table S\@ref(tab:ab-param) for model predicted parameters). We find that leaf conductance declined more rapidly with declining $\Psi_{leaf}$ for species with higher values of WSG and LMA (Fig. S\@ref(fig:obs-plc-curves)). Whether such scaling relationships between hard and soft traits hold true for other forests, and their wider applicability, remains to be seen as data on PLC curves are limited in tropical forests, but supportive and counter examples both exist [@McCulloh.2011; @Hoffmann.2011] (RCT: "K~leaf~ folks, Suggest if there are more references from the tropics, or relevant ones elsewhere. Also, could you comment on how rare this $K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$ dataset is?").

\
We also note that the availability of data on $\delta^2H$ on trees and water sources below-ground--from soil or substrate pore water in the vadose zone and free water below the water table--as important for model calibration or validation. The model in @Chitra-Tarak.2018 were not corroborated with such data as existing methods were inadequate to extract water bound to the saprolite found in their dry forest study site (Jean Riotte, pers. comm.). The model of below-ground water-availability in this study (ELM-FATES) is far more advanced compared to that used by @Chitra-Tarak.2018 and was calibrated with data on long-term soil moisture dynamics at a point location (0-0.15m) and plot-wide measurements by depth (0.15, 0.4 and 1 m), as well as, evapotranspiration and stream discharge. @Chitra-Tarak.2018 was calibrated only on stream discharge and water table levels. We lacked data on water table levels which would have been useful to constrain water availability dynamics in the unobserved soil layers. As in @Chitra-Tarak.2018, we also interpret our ERD estimates as revealing relative differences among species' effective rooting depths rather than in absolute terms.

### Future Directions for Model Development
\
The trade-offs that we identify between above- and below-ground traits, the water environment vertically below-ground and mortality rates are important for representing diversity in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models especially in species-rich forests. The hydraulic efficiency-safety trade-off between high values of maximum leaf or stem conductivity (high $K_{max}$) and cavitation-resistance (low $\Psi_{50}$ or $\Psi_{88}$) is hypothesized although community-wide examples are rare [@Hacke:2006; @Gleason.2016]. Such a trade-off is found at our study site at both leaf and stem level (Zailaa et al. to be submitted; Wolfe et al. in revision). We also found that LMAand WSG were strong predictors of PLC curves for leaves, but not for stems (not shown). Acquisitive traits such as high $K_{max}$ are expected to be associated with faster growth rates. We found a positive but non- significant relationship of adult growth rates ($\ge$ 10cm dbh) with $K_{max, ~leaf}$ (*R*^2^ = 0.13; *P* = 0.126, *n* = `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)`) and no relationship with $K_{max, ~stem}$ (*n* = `r stem.traits.sp` species). The relationships between ERD and above-ground hydraulic traits that we find will provide an important insight on how to model rooting depths and their coordination or trade-offs with other traits in order to better represent the functional diversity of tropical forests.

\
Our model estimated ERD as a single value, unlike the dynamic ERD modeled by @Chitra-Tarak.2018, but future model developments should investigate seasonal dynamics of ERD, using corresponding calibration data on isotopically determined water-sourcing depths. Our inverse ERD model was parameterized on 5-yearly growth data, with five data points over a 25-yr period, which decouples climate events and demographic outcomes. Future studies could better constrain the model with higher resolution growth data such as those from dendrometer bands. This is especially important for modeling seasonally dynamic ERD. However, trees' stem diameter change is a sum total of not just growth, the addition of wood, but also changes due to hydrostatic stem flexing, importance of which increases with temporal resolution [@Chitra-Tarak.2016; @Chitra-Tarak.2015]. Use of dendrometer data would thus entail accounting for stem hydrostatic flexing [@Zweifel:2018]. Three of our exploratory ERD models included seasonality in leaf area fraction, but we did not select them as they worsened the fit with growth data and evaluation data ($\delta^2H$, Fig. S\@ref(fig:other-erd-mods)). We interpret this result as that VPD and PLC curves may be adequate to explain growth, but also acknowledge that our estimates of seasonality of leaf cover is a tentative estimate combining leaf fall data and assumption of leaf presence during the wet season, and omits inter-annual variation. Future studies could make use of data from new technologies such as drone based monitoring of species-specific leaf area fraction in species-rich forests [@Park.2019]. In forests such as BCI where understory tree growth is more limited by availability of light rather than water, inversely estimating ERD for smaller tree size classes, especially from a few growth data points, may need accounting for variation in trees' light environment over time and among trees of the same size class, an issue we minimized by limiting ERD estimates to canopy trees. To estimate topographic variation in ERD within or across species future studies may use soil moisture dynamics from a distributed hydrological model [e.g. @Schwantes:2018]. We note that data availability on soil water retention curve ($\Psi_{soil}$ vs. VWC), hydraulic conductivity ($K_{soil}$) by depth, soil moisture by depth, stream discharge and evapotranspiration were important for effective calibration of our 1-D hydrological model. We recommend wide-spread data collection of these variables as well as water-table levels in forest-inventory sites to allow for estimation of trees' water environments. Finally, developing an inverse ERD model that accounts for movement of water within the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum (SPAC) would be a step change from the current statistical models of ERD (this study and @Chitra-Tarak.2018). Although data needs for parameterizing such models [@Christoffersen:2016kd2d; @Sperry.1998] could be greater (e.g. retention curves for roots), which limits immediate community-wide application, such models hold greater promise to improve our understanding of plant physiology [e.g. see @Johnson:2018fad].

Establishing relationships between plant's environment, traits and demographic outcomes is imperative for developing a predictive plant ecology, but trees realized water environments and water-access are rarely studied. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a mechanistic link between trees' realized drought experience, above-ground hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes for a species-rich forest. The role of deep-water access that we find in alleviating mortality of drought-sensitive trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of tropical forest dynamics under current and future climate. Our community-scale framework for modeling effective rooting depths or leaf vulnerability curves indicate the possibilities in expanding the use of critical, hard-earned observations in species-rich forests towards community-scale generalizations.

### Data gaps in WSG and LMA

Among the `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)` species with observed data on ($K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$) used to build the community-level models of leaf vulnerability curves (Eqs. \@ref(eq:b-mod)-\@ref(eq:a-mod)), two lacked data on WSG and five on LMA~lamina~. We filled three gaps in LMA using predictions from a strong linear relationship between LMA and LMA~disc~, the latter defined as the mean leaf mass per unit area measured for a 1.483 cm^2^ leaf disc taken to avoid veins (g m^-2^) for leaves receiving direct sunlight ($\overline{LMA} = `r disc.cf[1]` + `r disc.cf[2]`LMA_{disc}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r disc.r2`; *P* `r disc.p`, *n* = `r disc.n`). We filled the two remaining gaps in LMA using predictions from a linear relationship between LMA and LMA~lamina~, as measured during the smaller, $K_{leaf}$ campaign ($\overline{LMA} = `r lma.cf[1]` + `r lma.cf[2]`LMA_{lamina}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r lma.r2`; *P* `r lma.p`, *n* = `r lma.n`). We chose not to fill the two data gaps in WSG as available data were poor predictors of WSG.

\
At the community level, we filled data gaps in $LMA$ for `r sum(c.lma.gaps[-which(names(c.lma.gaps) == "original")])` species (of total `r sum(c.lma.gaps)`)  using linear relationships with other variables: `r c.lma.gaps[[which(names(c.lma.gaps) == "filled-LMA-DISC")]]` species with $LMA_{disc}$, `r c.lma.gaps[[which(names(c.lma.gaps) == "filled-LMA-Nobby")]]` with $LMA_{lamina}$, and `r c.lma.gaps[[which(names(c.lma.gaps) == "filled-LEAF")]]` with $LMA_{leaf}$, defined as the mean leaf mass per unit area measured for the entire leaf including the petiole (g m^-2^) for leaves receiving direct sunlight ($\overline{LMA} = `r leaf.cf[1]` + `r leaf.cf[2]`LMA_{leaf}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r leaf.r2`; *P* `r leaf.p`, *n* = `r leaf.n`). For the `r sum(c.lma.gaps)` species thus with $LMA$, we gap-filled data on  WSG for `r sum(c.wsg.gaps[-which(names(c.wsg.gaps) == "original")])` species using a linear relationship with wood specific gravity reported by @Chave:2009 ($\overline{WSG} = `r chave.cf[1]` + `r chave.cf[2]`WSG_{chave}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r chave.r2`; *P* `r chave.p`, *n* = `r chave.n`).
