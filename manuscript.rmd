# Summary

- Among all the mechanisms plants employ to deal with drought, deep water access is arguably the most commonly invoked, but under-studied mechanism. Vulnerability to embolism and hydraulic safety margins are shown to be predictors of drought-induced mortality risk, but deep-water access may delay plants from reaching these critical thresholds. Here, we tested the role of deep-water access in survival strategies of a diverse tropical forest community (Panama) using a novel data-model approach. 
- We inversely modelled effective rooting depth (ERD) for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` canopy species by linking growth dynamics (1990-2015) to vapour pressure deficit, matric potentials in the whole-soil column, and a new community-scale model of species leaf vulnerability curves. We evaluated ERD against existing isotopic tracer data on trees and soil. 
- We find that deeper ERD is associated with higher stem hydraulic conductivity, greater vulnerability to xylem embolism, narrower safety margins, and lower mortality rates over 35 years. Deeper ERD species spent less time below critical hydraulic thresholds indicating that trees' mitigate water-stress related mortality risk through deep water access.
- The role of deep-water access in alleviating mortality of drought-sensitive trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of tropical forest dynamics under current and future climate.

# Introduction
\
Tropical forests play a disproportionately large role in the global carbon and energy cycle, and support half of global biodiversity [@Bonan:2008; @Wright:20050th], but face a threat from intensifying droughts [@Doughty:2015; @Xu.2019]. Tropical forests are considered an especially drought-vulnerable biome given the combination of climate risk and vegetation sensitivity [@Meir:2015trw]. Historic climatic variation is relatively small [@Mora.2013], and the observed ranges of trees' hydraulic safety margins are relatively narrow [@Choat:2012; but see @Oliveira:2019]. Widespread drought-induced mortality has already been observed across the tropics for specific tree groups [@Bennett:2015; @Chitra-Tarak.2018; @Hilker:2014; @Phillips:2010]. However, state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) fail to capture drought-induced vegetation dynamics in the tropics [@Galbraith.2010; @Powell:2013], as underlying mechanisms of drought-tolerance are not fully understood or quantified.

\
Among all the mechanisms plants employ to deal with drought, deep water access is arguably the most commonly invoked, but under-studied mechanism. This mechanism assumes that water availability varies belowground by vertical depth and so do rooting depths of co-occuring trees, by species and size [@Meinzer:1999; @Chitra-Tarak.2018]. Consequently, trees' in the same forest differ in their drought experience, and thus in their responses in term of growth and mortality. A key bottlneck in community-wide testing of this mechanism has been lack of data on trees' rooting or water-sourcing depths, followed by data on water-availability at those depths. A recent meta-analysis documented maximum rooting depths for 318 tree species, that is, less than 0.5% of the world’s 65 thousand tree species [@Fan:2017; @Beech:2017]. Further, only a small fraction of those are tropical, even though ~60-80 % (40 - 53 thousand species) of the World’s tree diversity resides in the tropics [@Slik:2015]. Use of stable isotopes of water as a tracer provides an indirect way of trees' water sourcing depths by matching isotopic value in plant tissue to variations in soil pore water vertically belowground. However, such data are extremely rare [@Evaristo:2016]. In general, community-scale data collection for rooting or water-sourcing depths is especially challenging for species-rich tropical forests. 

\
Trade-offs among co-occurring plants shape how they make a living in their environment (ecological strategies) and also provide the essential constraints to model species-rich communities under a changing environment [@Koven:2020; @Christoffersen:2016kd2d]. This entails indentifying trade-offs among environment, traits and demography. Specifically for the water environment (or resource) observations of individual trade-offs between environment-trait, trait-trait and trait-demography has identified an acquisitive-conservative resource economic spectrum similar to the ones for light and nutrients, although, for water, examples of all trade-offs observed simultaneously are rare, and belowground traits or environment linkages are weak (@Reich:2014; @Sterck:2011). Acquisitive species have traits with high capacity to acquire, move, store and use water (high $K_{max}$, low wood density) and achieve high growth potential, but build flimsy, disposable tissues (high SLA) and are less tolerant of low resources, whereas species with conservative traits are better protected from carbon losses and are more drought tolerant (low $\Psi_{50}$, low $\Psi_{tlp}$, larger safety margin). Acquisitive species are spatially associated with wet sites (high resource) such as valleys or those with high rainfall [@Kursar:2009; @Oliveira:2019], but whether and how the acquisitive-conservative spectrum holds true for the moisture dynamics vertically belowground is not clear. Deep rootedness may be expected to support an acquisitive strategy with a steady water supply unlike shallow-rooted trees. However, this may depend on the exact dynamics of water-availability by depth at a site, depending on precipitation regime and hydrology. In contrast, in pulse-driven arid systems *shallow*-rooted plants are associated with acquisitive traits (high $K_{max}$) that maximise the use of the water-pulse, while *deep*-rooted plants show conservative traits (cavitation-resistant xylem, osmoregulation) [@Schwinning:2013]. 

\
Huge efforts are invested in linking the same-for-all-trees drought indices, above-ground traits and demographic rates. These efforts have resulted in identification of above-ground traits such as proxies of hydraulic failure as indicators of mortality risk. A recent meta-analysis found greater drought-induced mortality rates in species with cavitation-vulnerable xylem ($\Psi_{88,~stem}$) and narrow safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$) [@Anderegg:2016], but counter examples also exist [@Hoffmann:2011; @Johnson:2018fad; @Nardini:2015; @Paddock:2013]; indicating that plants reach critical thresholds of hydraulic failure depending on their realised drought intensity (see Table \@ref(tab:symbols) for trait symbols and their definitions). However, plants' realised water environments are rarely studied, especially in the tropical region. To better understand how belowground rooting is linked to aboveground hydraulic traits and mortality for co-occuring tropical forest tree species, we make a thorough assessment of trade-offs between the belowground water environment, above-ground hydraulic traits, estimates of effective rooting depths and demographic outcomes over 34 years that witnessed droughts of various intensity and duration for a tropical site. Specifically, we test an overarching hypothesis that interspecific variation in effective rooting depths of trees aligns species on an acquisitive-conservative economic spectrum optimised for increasingly reliable water availability by depth such that (i) trees with deeper ERD have hydraulic traits associated with rapid water transport but cavitation-vulnerable xylem: higher maximum stem hydraulic conductance ($K_{max}$), but greater xylem vulnerability to embolism ($\Psi_{88,~stem}$), higher $\Psi_{tlp}$ and narrower hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$), whereas shallower ERD species are associated with less efficient but safer hydraulic traits; and that, (ii) deeper ERD species have lower mortality rates due to low realised risk of hydraulic failure, whereas shallower ERD species may have higher mortality rates as a result of higher variability in shallow soil water availability. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a mechanistic link between trees' realised drought experience, above-ground hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes for a species-rich forest.

# Materials and Methods
\
In the following sections we describe the study site, the models and data used to estimate and evaluate (1) soil water potential dynamics by depth over the forests’ rooting zone, (2) species-specific leaf vulnerability curves, and (3) species-specific effective rooting depths. These are followed by analyses to address the proposed hypotheses. Note that only new data on leaf vulnerability curves collected during this study are described below, details of all other datasets used are described in the Supplementary Information.

\
In summary, we obtained daily dynamics of plant water potential ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) by depth $z$ in the whole-soil column with a locally parametarised and calibrated 1-D hydrological water balance model. Developing a novel inverse model allowed us to estimate species effective rooting depths (ERD), defined as the depth ($z$) at which soil water dynamics ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) best explained observed dynamics of species growth (six 5-yearly censuses, 1990-2015). This model incorporated impact of atmospheric drought (VPD) on growth and was constrained by above-ground hydraulic traits, namely, species leaf vulnerability curves ($K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$). We collected new data on vulnerability curves for 21 species. Identifying scaling relationships between these curves and commonly available traits (Leaf Mass Area~lamina~, Wood Specific Gravity~100^$\circ$^C~; defined below) allowed us to scale-up these curves to `r length(data.model.AB$sp)` tree species in the community (of 321 total). We evaluated ERD against existing data on plant and soil water isotopes ($\delta^2H$) and coordination of ERD with hydraulic traits and mortality rates.

## Study Site Description
\
We conducted this study at the seasonally dry tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, given its extensive characterization in terms of long-term forest demography, plant functional ecology, hydrology, and water sourcing depth water isotopes on tree species and soil from an independent isotopic tracer study on trees’ water-sourcing depths [@Meinzer:1999]. The 1,560ha island was formed after the river Chagres was dammed in 1914 that created Gatun Lake, the main channel of the Panama Canal. Rainfall at BCI is seasonal with a mean annual rainfall of `r round(mean(clim$Precip))` mm ($pm$ `r round(sd(clim$Precip))` SD; `r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`) and a four-month long dry season from mid-December through mid-April ($\le$ 100 mm rain/month). Mean annual Penman-Monteith evapo-transpiration is `r round(mean(clim$pet.PM))` mm ($pm$ `r round(sd(clim$pet.PM))` SD; `r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`). The entire island is forested and classified as a tropical moist forest. Although percentage of canopy species that are at least partly deciduous during the dry season is 28%, the maximum percentage of deciduous individuals in the canopy is only 6.3%, and the percentage of crown area that is deciduous is estimated at 9.7% [@Condit:2000]. Long-term hydrological monitoring at BCI began in 1972, while demographical monitoring began with the 50ha ForestGEO plot establishment in 1981-82 [@Condit.1998uq; @Hubbell:1999; @Anderson-Teixeira:2014].

\
In the 50ha plot all stems above 10 mm diameter at breast height (dbh) are mapped, tagged with a unique number, identified to species level and measured every 5 years through 1985-2015 for growth, mortality as well as recruitment of new stems into the 10 mm size class [@Condit.2017]. This inventory represents 321 woody species across the eight censuses. Aside from a 2ha patch of ~100-year-old secondary forest at the north-eastern corner of the plot the remaining 48 ha represent old growth forest that was never clear cut for agriculture. The plot (100 m x 50 m) was originally chosen for its relative uniformity of relief and other physical conditions; the elevation range is only 40 m (120-160 m) [@Harms:2001]. The plot covers most of the upper catchment of Conrad Creek. The shallow valley of this creek is the main interruption to the otherwise mostly flat or gently sloping plot. The valley gives rise to the 1.5-ha swamp at the end of the wet season. Soils of the plot are homogenous with red light clays, described as the Ava soil type, accounting for 72.4% of the plot (BCI soil survey report). The topsoil field texture is silty clay loam that gradually fines to silty clay in the subsoil. Soil is mostly free draining, but restricted subsoil permeability gives rise to temporary wet season ponding. Detailed descriptions of the climate, geology, flora and fauna of BCI can be found elsewhere [@Croat.1978; Leigh.1982; @Gentry.1990].

## Model ELM-FATES for Soil Matric Potentials

### Model description

\
To estimate dynamics of water availability by depth over the forest’s root zone, we implemented a 1-D hydrological model, the Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model (ELM), coupled with a Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) (hereafter, ELM-FATES). FATES is a state-of-the-art, community-based, open-source model used for studying climate-vegetation interactions. FATES is considered a next generation vegetation dynamics model for ELM, with a size-structured group of plants (cohorts) and successional trajectory-based patches using the ecosystem demography approach. FATES couples to ELM by a common interface of water and carbon fluxes. Detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere [@Koven:2020; @Fisher:2014; @Bonan:2013].

\
Below we describe the equation of water balance in ELM-FATES that is most relevant for our study site, even though ELM-FATES is capable of incorporating numerous other hydrological processes relevant for wetlands and lakes and snow [@Bonan:2013]. ELM-FATES parameterizes interception, throughfall, canopy drip, infiltration, evaporation, surface runoff, subsurface drainage, redistribution within the soil column, and groundwater discharge and recharge so as to simulate changes in canopy water $\Delta W_{can}$, surface water $\Delta W_{sfc}$, soil water $\Delta W_{liq, z}$, and water in an unconfined aquifer $\Delta W_{a}$ (omitting processes relevant to snow, wetlands or lakes), and can be described as

\begin{equation}
\Delta W_{can} + \Delta W_{sfc} + \sum_{z=1}^{15} \Delta W_{liq,z} + \Delta W_{a} = \left(q_{rain} - E_{v} - E_{g} - q_{over} - q_{h2osfc} - q_{drai}\right)\Delta t
(\#eq:water-balance)
\end{equation}

where, $q_{rain}$ is rainfall, $E_{v}$ is evapotranspiration (ET) of the forest, $E_{g}$ is ground evaporation, $q_{over}$ is surface runoff, $q_{h2osfc}$ is runoff from surface water storage, $q_{drai}$ is sub-surface drainage (all in mm H~2~O) and $\Delta t$ is the time-step. $z$ represents the depths of exponentially distributed 15 soil layers, here, `r paste(soil.depths, collapse=", ")` (m).

### Model parameterization
\
To parameterise the model, we identified eleven parameters relevant for Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), determined their ranges based on literature for the study site or for the tropics (Table \@ref(tab:param)), and sampled 5000 ensembles from this parameter space with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). In the Conrad catchment soil hydraulic conductivity declined by depth based on existing data for the depths of 12.5 and 60 cm (@Kinner:2004; Table \@ref(tab:param)). We generated 5000 LHS samples within the 95% CI for the two depths and assumed a linear decline between each paired sample, while for depths < 12.5 cm and > 60 cm, we assumed the same value as that for depths 12.5 and 60 cm, respectively (Fig. S\@ref(fig:ksat-profiles)). For all runs, instead of ELM's default soil texture-based soil water retention curve, we used a curve that we derived from existing data on volumetric water content ($\theta$) vs. $\Psi_{soil}$ for depths 15, 40 and 100 cm [@Kupers:2019]. A @Campbell.1974 empirical equation was fitted for all depths pooled together, as exploratory analyses indicated differences among depths were nominal:

\begin{equation}
\Psi_{soil} = \Psi_e\left(\frac{\theta}{\theta_{s}}\right)^{-b}
(\#eq:soil-ret-curve)
\end{equation}

where $\Psi_e$ is the air-entry matric potential (200, mmH~2~O), $\theta_{s}$ is the saturated volumetric water content (0.51, cm^3^cm^-3^), and $b$, an index for soil pore-size distribution (10, unitless), respectively. 
\
We ran ELM-FATES for the 5000 parameter ensembles with hourly climate drivers from 1985-2018 initialised with the stand structure of the 50ha plot in a single site mode ($0.1^\circ$ x $0.1^\circ$ centered at $9.1530^\circ$N, $280.2539^\circ$E). As our key interest here was in soil water availability rather than forest dynamics, we ran ELM-FATES in simplified modes: static stand structure and without plant hydrodynamics, and with a single Plant Functional Type (PFT) of evergreen trees. The latter was chosen as only 9.7% of BCI crown area is dry-season deciduous and addition of dry-deciduous PFT did not significantly alter results (not shown). 

### Model evaluation

\
We calibrated the model over 2012-2018 against three key fluxes in Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), namely, (i) evapotranspiration ($ET \simeq E_{v} + E_{g}$) from the eddy flux tower (2012-2017), (ii) stream discharge for the Conrad Catchment ($q_{run} \simeq q_{over} + q_{drai}$; 2012-2018) and (iii) volumetric water content (VWC, $\theta_{z} \simeq W_{liq, z}$; 2012-2018). We collected VWC data (2012-2018) from a point location at the eddy flux tower with a vertical Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probe ($\theta_{0-0.15m}$). This data was calibrated based on measurements of gravimetric soil moisture at the vertical probe (0-15 cm) on several occasions (Fig. \@ref(fig:TDR-calib)) and mean bulk dry density of 0.8 gcm^-3^ (*n* = 5, cylinder volume = 1250 cm^3^). We also leveraged existing opportunistic dry season VWC measurements by depth for the entire 50-ha plot ($\theta_{0.15m}$, $\theta_{0.4m}$ and $\theta_{1m}$ in 2015 and $\theta_{0.15m}$, $\theta_{0.4m}$ in 2016; @Kupers:2019). Beginning in 2016 we additionally installed three horizontal probes at depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1m, but depth specific calibration equation was not available, so we applied the same calibration equation to these data as that of the vertical probe. However, for VWC calibration we only used data from the vertical probe to capture the long-term dynamics and plot-wide measurements to capture the dynamics by depth. To find parameter ensembles that best-fit all three fluxes simultaneously, we calculated an objective function for each of the 5000 ensembles based on root mean square error (RMSE) between observations and simulations. Let $f(obs,~sim)$ be normalised RMSE (0-1) between observations and simulations, based on monthly sums for $ET$ and $q_{run}$ and daily avarages for $\theta$s, then the objective function ($Z$) is described as:

\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{1}{6}\sum \left(f(ET,~E_{v} + E_{g}) + f(q_{run},~q_{over} + q_{drai}) + f(\theta_{0-0.15m}, {W_{liq,~\bar{z}}})  + f(\theta_{0.15m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[4]`m}) + f(\theta_{0.4m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[6]`m}) + f(\theta_{1m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[8]`m})\right)
(\#eq:obj-func)
\end{equation}

where $W_{liq,~\bar{z}}$ is the daily average of $W_{liq,~z}$ for $z$ = `r paste(soil.depths[1:4], collapse=", ")` m. To ensure calibration with $\theta_{0.1m}$, we first selected ensembles with  $f(\theta_{1m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[8]`m})$ < 0.2 (~300 ensembles) and among them selected 100 ensembles with lowest values for the objective function $Z$. Model simulations corresponding to these 100 best-fit ensembles are shown against observed fluxes in Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib), including VWC from horizontal probes that were not used for calibration. See Table \@ref(tab:param) for the range of best-fit values for different parameters. We ran ELM-FATES with the chosen 100 ensembles from 1985-2018, with first 5 years used for model spin-up.

## Model for Leaf Vulnerability Curves at Community-scale
\
We measured ($K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$) on adult trees of `r length(unique(data.model.AB[!is.na(data.model.AB$data.A),]$sp))` common species (see SI--Joseph please add a section). We fitted exponential, sigmoidal, logistic equations to species-level data as prescribed by @Guyot:2011. Exponential form was chosen, because based on AIC criteria it best-fitted all but one species, and for the one species it fitted only slightly worse (Fig. S\@ref(fig:obs-vuln-curves); we might want to add specie-specific panel of graphs showing data and fitted curves here), described as

\begin{equation}
K_{leaf} = Ae^{-B\Psi_{leaf}} + error
(\#eq:vc-exp)
\end{equation}

where $A$ and $B$ are fitted species-specific parameters. We identified scaling relationships between fitted parameters $A$ and $B$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) and two traits that were available at community-scale, namely, mean wood specific gravity after drying at 100$^\circ$C ($WSG$ or, WSG~100^$\circ$^C~; gcm^-3^) and mean leaf mass per unit area measured for the leaf lamina excluding the petiole and for compound leaves the petiolules ($LMA$ or LMA~lamina~; gm^-2^) for leaves receiving direct sunlight. Fitted polynomial equations are described as,

\begin{equation}
A = `r acf[1]` `r acf[2]`WSG `r acf[3]`WSG^2 + `r acf[4]`WSGB + `r acf[5]`B `r acf.6`B^2 + error
(\#eq:a-mod)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B = `r bcf[1]` `r bcf[2]`B + `r bcf[3]`B^2 + `r bcf[4]`BLMA + `r bcf[5]`LMA `r bcf[6]`LMA^2 + error
(\#eq:b-mod)
\end{equation}

$WSG$ & parameter $B$ explained a large proportion of variation in parameter $A$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:a-mod); Adj. R^2^ = `r signif(glance(k_by_psi.models[[2]])$adj.r.squared, 2)`; *P* = `r signif(glance(k_by_psi.models[[2]])$p.value, 2)`; also see Fig. S\@ref(fig:ab-fit)). $WSG$ & $LMA$ explained a large proportion of variation in parameter $B$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod); Adj. *R*^2^ = `r signif(glance(k_by_psi.models[[1]])$adj.r.squared, 2)`; *P* = `r  signif(glance(k_by_psi.models[[1]])$p.value, 2)`). We thus sequentially used Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod) and \@ref(eq:a-mod) to predict parameters $B$ and $A$, respectively, for the `r length(unique(data.model.AB$sp))` species for which WSG and LMA data were available and fitted vulnerability curves (see Fig. \@ref(fig:comm-vuln-curves)).

## Model for Effective Rooting Depths (ERD)
\
Water is a key limiting resource for tree growth. Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and water supply as determined by soil moisture are factors known to influence trees water uptake [@Lawrence.2019]. In this study, we used leaf conductivity ($K_leaf$) determined by rhizosphere soil water potential ($\Psi_{soil}$) as an approximation of the soil water limiting factor. For dry-deciduous species seasonality in leaf cover may also influence plant water uptake. We therefore tested alternate models of growth, aka inverse models for ERD (Eqs. \@ref(eq:M2)- \@ref(eq:M4)), in which a species' growth dynamics across census intervals was regressed against census interval means of multiplied effects of one or more factors calculated daily: VPD, $K_{leaf}$ and the fraction of leaf cover (all standardised to 0-1, see below). Let n~t~ be the total number of days in census interval $t$, then for individual tree species Growth~t~ and depth $z$ these models are described as follows:

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} + error
(\#eq:M1)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} StdVPD_{n} + error
(\#eq:M2)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} LeafCover_{doy} + error
(\#eq:M3)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Growth_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{day=1}^{n_{t}} StdK_{leaf,~z,~n} LeafCover_{doy}StdVPD_{n} + error
(\#eq:M4)
\end{equation}
\
We estimated daily value of $K_{leaf,z,n}$ by plugging in $\Psi_{soil,~z,~n}$ in the leaf PLC curves Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) as:

\begin{equation}
K_{leaf,~z,~n} = Ae^{-B\Psi_{soil,~z,~n}}
(\#eq:k-soil)
\end{equation}
\
We estimated species effective rooting depths (ERD), defined as the depth ($z$) at which soil water dynamics ($\Psi_{soil,~z}$) best explained observed dynamics of species growth (six 5-yearly censuses, 1990-2015; see below).

### Model parameterization
\
For growth estiamtes, to minimise the effect of light variation among trees, we selected only large trees ($\ge$ 30 cm dbh, diameter at breast height) and species whose maximum height was at least 30 m (hereafter, canopy species) and thus are likely to be fully exposed to the sun. We selected trees for which height of diameter measurement was unchanged across all censuses (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015). For each individual tree (*i*), we calculated growth rates ($Gr_{i,t}$; cm.yr^-1^) for each of the five census intervals ($t$) as the difference between tree dbh measured in successive censuses, divided by the inter-census interval based on the exact date of measurements. We eliminated positive outliers as any growth rates amounting to > 75 mm.yr^-1^, as this was the highest rate observed with confidence for fastest growing species [@Condit.2017]. Negative outliers were removed based on known measurement error, $\sigma_{e} = 0.006214d + 0.903$, where *d* is dbh. Any stem whose later dbh measurement fell < 4$\sigma_{e}$ the earlier measurement was removed [@Condit.2017]. As tree growth rates vary with size, to keep growth rates comparable across census intervals, we obtained residuals from a dbh model of tree growth based on a tree's dbh at the beginning of a census interval ($Resid_{i,t} = Gr_{i,t} - f(d_{i, t})$). The diameter model of growth ($f(d_{i, t})$), a B-spline based polynomial equation with 5 degrees of freedom, was fitted to growth rates from all trees pooled together as there was insufficient species-specific data for large trees (Fig. S\@ref(fig:dbh-model))). We retained only those trees that had $Resid_{i,t}$ estimates across all censuses (complete records, total trees = `r sum(g.n$n)`) and standardized (centered and scaled) individual tree time series of $Resid_{i,t}$. We then obtained species-level (*n* = `r length(erd.sp)`) time-series of medians of $Resid_{i,t}$ ($Growth_{t}$). These were obtained for only those species with complete records on at least three trees (median *n* = `r median(g.n$n)`, max *n* = `r max(g.n$n)` trees).
\
There are many factors that could affect plant growth, including soil moisture, VPD, leaf area, temperature and radiation. Based on our preliminary analyses, incorporation of temperature and radiation did not improve our model fitting, thus we mainly focused on the impact of soil moisture, VPD and leaf area in our models.
\
As VPD may have a non-linear relationship with growth, we fitted a polynomial curve between mean daily values by month of gross primary productivity (gCm^2^day^-1^) and VPD we collected from the eddy flux tower (kPa; $\bar{GPP} = -18.8VPD^2 + 14.5VPD + 5.02 + error = StdVPD$; 2012-2017; Fig. S\@ref(fig:gpp-vpd)) and used standardised $\bar{GPP}$ to represent the impact of VPD on growth ($StdVPD$; range 0-1) in Eqs. \@ref(eq:M2) and \@ref(eq:M4). Due to coincidence of higher temperature, higher radiation, and lower humidity during the dry season at our study site, the VPD impact may as well be a combined impact of temperature, humidity, and radiation.
\
To explore the effect of species seasonality in leaf cover on growth, we made an informed assumption of species-specific seasonal curves for Leaf Cover Fraction ($LeafCover$, range 0-1, unitless). For evergreen species we assumed $LeafCover$ = 1 throughtout the year, whereas for species with all other decisuous classes, we assumed $LeafCover$ = 1 during the wet season (DOY = 150 to 300), given high forest leaf area index for this period (data not shown). We interpolated species-specific weekly leaf-fall data collected at two similar sites in BCI (1985-2020) to a daily estimate, scaled to express daily leaf fall as a fraction of the total leaf fall in a given year and obtained an average leaf fall fraction by DOY estimate across years ($LeafFall$, range 0-1, unitless). For non-evergreen species, we cumulatively deducted $LeafFall$ from $LeafCover$ = 1 beginning DOY = 300 and obtained a $LeafCover$ by DOY curve (\@ref(fig:leaf-cover)). We obtained species-specific parameters $A$ & $B$ for Eq. \@ref(eq:k-soil) either from data when available, or a model based on $LMA$ or $WSG$ as described in the earlier section, and used standardised K within species ($Std.K$; range 0-1) in Eqs. \@ref(eq:M1)- \@ref(eq:M4).
\
For the combination of each model \@ref(eq:M1)- \@ref(eq:M4), species and hydrological realisation, we obtained AIC, goodness-of-fit (*R*^2^) and Pearson's $\rho$ for each soil depth $z$. For each model-species-hydrological realisation we retained only one depth each with the least AIC as the best-fit, and retained only the subset of depths that had a positive Pearson's $\rho$ and *R*^2^ >= 0.5. For each model-species, we defined effective rooting depth (ERD) as the median of this subset of depths and calculated standard error.

### Model evaluation

For each model, species ERD was regressed against species Xylem sap $\delta^2H$ (%~$\circ$~; *n* = 7). We used Xylem sap $\delta^2H$ values given in [@Meinzer:2001] for the dry-season (March 1997) as these showed largest seasonal divergence among species, with a corresponding gradient of $\delta^2H$ in the soil. We removed species that are deciduous in March as xylem sap $\delta^2H$ of these species may not be linked with water sourced in March and thus may not comparable to other species with leaves present. Fig. S\@ref(fig:iso-data). We also removed *Guapira* *standleyana*, whose xylem sap isotope value was not well constrained by the soil water isotope depth profile.

The model with VPD and without Leaf Cover had highest goodness-of fit (*R*^2^ = 0.51; *p* = 0.072), followed by model without both VPD and Leaf Cover (Eq. \@ref(eq:M1); Fig. S\@ref(fig:other-erd-mods)). Models with Leaf Cover had only three species with sufficient species-level goodness-of-fit (Eqs. \@ref(eq:M3)-\@ref(eq:M4)) versus seven for models without (Eqs. \@ref(eq:M1)-\@ref(eq:M2)). For rest of the analyses we therefore used species ERD estimates from the model with VPD and without Leaf Cover (Eq. \@ref(eq:M2)).

## ERD Coordination with Above-ground Hydraulic Traits
\
To evaluate whether ERD was associated with above-ground hydraulic traits (*n* = 8 species with both datasets), we regressed species ERD with maximum stem hydraulic conductance ($K_{max, stem}$), leaf turgor loss point ($\Psi_{tlp}$), vulnerability to embolism from cavitation measured in terms of pressure at which 88% of stem hydraulic conductivity is lost ($\Psi_{88,~stem}$), and hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$). See SI for data collection and estimation of these variables (--Brett please add a section).

## Mortality Analyses and Extreme Drought Experience
\
We calculated mortality rates for large trees ($\ge$ 10 cm dbh) of species with ERD estimates (all canopy species with maximum height $\ge$ 30 m) and average adbunance of at least 20 trees (one species with an average abundance of 9 trees was eliminated; *n* = `r length(erd.mrate.sp)`). For each of the seven census intervals ($t$) in the 34-yr record (1982, 1985, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2015), species $Mort_{t}$ (%yr^-1^) for two successive censuses (cen~1~ and cen~2~) was calculated as $Mort_{t} = \frac{D_{cen_{2}}}{N_{cen_{1}}}.\frac{100}{time}$, where $N_{cen_{1}}$ and $D_{cen_{1}}$ are the total number of trees in the 50ha plot of a species present in cen~1~ and dead in cen~2~, respectively, and $time$ is the duration based on mean dates of cen~1~ and cen~2~. We calculated species mean mortality rate across all intervals as $Mort_{mean} = \frac{1}{6}\sum_{t=1}^{6} {Mort_{t}}$ and, finally, species mortality anomalies by intervals as $Mort_{anomaly}$ = $Mort_{t}$ - $Mort_{mean}$. To test whether ERD plays a role in alleviating mortality risk, we regressed species ERD against species ($Mort_{mean}$). To assess whether this may be due to deeper ERD species escaping the experience of catastrophic soil drought, we calculated the proportion of days over the study period (1990-2015) for which soil water potential in the soil zone matching species ERD ($\Psi_{ERD}$) were below species $\Psi_{crit}$, defined as $\Psi_{80,~leaf}$.
\
All statistical analyses were done in R statistical environment (version 3.5.3, @R:2019).

# Results

## Effective Rooting Depths, Vulnerability to Embolism and Hydraulic Safety Margins

\
In comparison to the measured isotopic signal, our results showed that the ERD model with VPD and without Leaf Cover (Eq. \@ref(eq:M2)) had highest goodness-of fit (*R*^2^ = 0.51; *p* = 0.072) and was thus the chosen model of ERD for rest of the analyses. Notably, two species, *Luehea* *seemannii* and *Trichilia tuberculata*, that @Meinzer:1999 found to have xylem sap $\delta^2H$ values between soil water and groundwater, suggesting that these species sourced most of the water from depths > 1 m, were also identified by our model with ERD > 1 m (2.9 m for both species). (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-iso)).

In this forest modelled effective rooting depths (ERD) for the `r length(erd.sp)` large, canopy tree species varied from `r min(df.erd.to.plot$depth)` m to `r max(df.erd.to.plot$depth)` m (Fig. \@ref(fig:sp-erd)). For the subset of species for which hydraulic properties were available, species with deeper ERD showed greater maximum stem hydraulic conductance ($K_{max,~stem}$; *R*^2^ = 0.39, *P* = 0.098, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)A), less negative leaf ($\Psi_{tlp}$); *R*^2^ = 0.6, p = 0.024, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)B), greater vulnerability to embolism from cavitation with less negative ($\Psi_{88,~stem}$) (*R*^2^ = 0.72, p = 0.007, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)C), and narrower hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$; *R*^2^ = 0.74, p = 0.013, *n* = 8; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)D).

## Effective Rooting Depths, Experienced Drought and Mortality

\
Species with deeper ERD showed lower mean mortality rates across the 34-yr record (1982-2015; *R*^2^ = 0.11, *P* = 0.075, *n* = `r length(erd.mrate.sp)`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-mort)). For five out of seven census intervals, species with shallower ERD had significantly higher mortality anomalies than deeper ERD species; Fig. (\@ref(fig:erd-mort-anom)). Analysis of time spent under catastrophic soil drought showed that the proportion of days species $\Psi_{ERD}$ was more negative than species $\Psi_{crit}$ decreased with species ERD (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-time)). Species with ERD deeper than 1 m did not cross species $\Psi_{crit}$ for the entire 25-yr period for which soil water potential $\Psi_{soil,~z}$ was modelled (1990-2015), as soil depths below 1 m remained above `r round(psi.1.7.min$median, 2)` (`r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q97.5), 2)`, `r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q2.5), 2)`) (median, 95% CI) through all the dry seasons and drought periods, which is above ($\Psi_{crit}$) of the most sensitive tree species (-0.28 MPa).

# Discussion
\
Our analyses revealed that co-occurring large canopy tree species (*n* = `r length(erd.sp)`) with deeper effective rooting depths (ERD) were associated with higher hydraulic efficiency, but not safety. Deep ERD species showed higher maximum stem hydraulic conductance, but greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower hydraulic safety margins compared to shallow ERD species. This trade-off translated into greater drought tolerance, as deeper ERD species showed lower mortality rates than shallower ERD species over the 34-yr record (1982-2015). Analysis of time spent below ($\Psi_{crit}$) in the soil zone matching ERD $\Psi_{soil,~z = ERD}$ showed that this was likely due to decreasing realised risk of hydraulic failure with depth. We thus show, for the first time, that interspecific variation in trees' effective rooting depths aligns species on a conservative-acquisitive water economic spectrum by demonstrating a link between trees' realised drought experience, hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes. On the acquisitive end of the spectrum were deep ERD species with hydraulically efficient, but risky suit of traits optimised for an environment of reliable and abundant source of water at depth that actualised to a lower mortality-risk. At the conservative end of the spectrum were shallow ERD species with inefficient, but safer xylem, likely optimised for high variability in $\Psi_{soil}$ in the shallow soil layers, resulting in higher variance in mortality rates across censuses as $\Psi_{soil,~z = ERD}$ crossed ERD $\Psi_{crit}$. Mortality rates of shallow ERD species may have been exacerbated by increased drought events during the study period. Previous work shows that half of the extreme dry seasons, estimated as < 1 SD annual water deficit, during 1931-2015 (85-yr) occurred during 1982-2005 (24-yr) of the 34-yr long study period (1982-2015; @Condit.2017).

### Realised drought risk integral to assessing drought-vulnerability
\
Our study brings attention to the need for assessing drought-sensitivity in terms of species realised drought risk. We found that species accessing deeper water had greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower branch hydraulic safety margins traits, which are commonly  are identified as proxies for mortality risk, but they were less droughted and had lower mortality compared to species relying on shallower water through a study period of greater recurrence of drought. These results are consistent with the rare studies that studied three or four species each with known rooting or water sourcing depths and assesed their hydraulic traits and mortality rates during a centennial (Texas) or extreme (Italy) drought [@Johnson:2018fad; @Nardini:2015]. @Johnson:2018fad found that mortality decreased with deep rooting even though deep rooted species were more vulnerable to xylem cavitation (high $\Psi_{88,~stem}$) and had narrower safety-margins ($\Psi_{min} - \Psi_{88,~stem}$). @Nardini:2015 found that a species sourcing deep water in a Karst system (Italy) showed lower hydraulic failure and mortality in an extreme drought despite having high $\Psi_{88,~stem}$ and narrower safety margin compared to two species sourcing shallow-water. Our result of lower mortality in deep rooted trees contrasts with the finding of @Chitra-Tarak.2018, who found that species identified by their inverse ERD model as effectively deep rooted died *more* in a prolonged, centennial drought. Their hydrological model found that in the multi-annual drought deep water was exhausted for over two years, whereas our hydrological modeling at BCI finds that despite higher frequency of droughts during our study period $\Psi_{soil}$ below the depth of 1 m remained above `r round(psi.1.7.min$median, 2)` (`r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q97.5), 2)`, (median; `r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q2.5), 2)`, 95% CI) through all the dryseasons and drought periods, that is above ($\Psi_{crit}$) of the most sensitive tree species (-0.28 MPa). The difference in our results are likely attributable to site differences in the precipitation regime. In their dry forest site (Mudumalai National Park, India) precipitation is low (1095 $\pm$ 296 mm; mean $\pm$ SD) compared to BCI (`r round(mean(clim$Precip))` $pm$ `r round(sd(clim$Precip))` mm), and precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratio at Mudumalai is nearly one (PET = 980 $\pm$ 64 mm), whereas at BCI it is nearly two (PET = `r round(mean(clim$pet.PM))` ($pm$ `r round(sd(clim$pet.PM))` mm), and thus at BCI deep soil layers are effectively recharged annually [@Chitra-Tarak.2018 and this study]. We note that the variation in mortality explained by ERD in our study is low (*R*^2^ = 0.11, *P* = 0.075), and other causes may explain observed mortality. 

### Effective rooting depths at the tree community level
\
By estimating ERD for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` canopy tree species, we make an important advance in modeling effective rooting depths at the community level in species species-rich tropical forests. Our chosen ERD model is an advancement over the only other inverse model of ERD (or water uptake depth index, @Chitra-Tarak.2018, *n* = 12 species) in terms of physiologically meaningful representation, fewer parameters, corroboration with tree and soil data on $\delta^2H$. The model in @Chitra-Tarak.2018 estimated six species-specific phenomenological parameters: three as root fraction for corresponding lumped vadose zone layers, and three as shape parameters for water uptake vs availability curves. For each species, they calculated daily water uptake successively from three layers--the supply, to satisfy the demand of the daily maximum evapo-transpiration, a function of PET and LAI. They regressed total supply to total demand ratio over census intervals (termed as growth coefficient) against growth (5 data points), and chose values for six parameters that best-fit (highest R^2^, that is, 2 additional parameters). Our inverse ERD model fits only two parameters by way of regressing depth-specific model against 5 growth data points. Our model was constrained on VPD and species leaf vulnerability (PLC) curves, variables that are shown to be physiologically meaningful [add references]. We benefitted from finding a strong scaling relationship between commonly collected 'soft' traits at the community scale (LMA~lamina~ and WSG~100^$\circ$^C~) and parameters of PLC curves for which we collected data on a few species (*n* = 14), a 'hard' trait. This allowed us to scale-up PLC curves at the community scale (*n* = 284 species). We find that per cent loss of conductivity was more rapid for soft wooded and low LMA species as $\Psi_{leaf}$ declined (Fig. S\@ref(fig:comm-plc-curves)A & S\@ref(fig:comm-plc-curves)B). Whether such scaling relationships between hard and soft traits hold true for other forests, and their wider applicability, remains to be seen as data on PLC curves are limited in tropical forests, but counter examples exist [Lawren, could you suggest references? Also, folks, is our $K_{leaf}$ vs. $\Psi_{leaf}$ data the first reported for a tropical forest? or could you add how rare it is?]. We also note the availability of data on $\delta^2H$ on trees and water sources belowground--soil/substrate matrix water in the vadoze zone or free water below the water table--as important for model calibration/validation. The model in @Chitra-Tarak.2018 were not corroborated with such data as existing methods were inadequate to extract water bound to the soil and saprolite found in their dry forest study site (Jean Riotte, pers. comm.). The model of belowground water-availability in this study (ELM-FATES) is far more advanced compared to that used by @Chitra-Tarak.2018 and was calibrated with data on soil moisture dynamics by depth (15, 40, 100 cm), as well as, evapotranspiration and stream discharge. @Chitra-Tarak.2018 was calibrated only on stream discharge and water table levels. We lacked data on water table levels which would have been useful to constrain water availability dynamics in the unobserved soil layers.

### Future Directions for Model Development
\
The trade-offs that we identify between above- and below-ground traits, water environment vertically belowground and mortality are important for representing diversity in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models especially in species-rich forests. The hydraulic efficiency-safety trade-off between high values of maximum leaf or stem conductivity (high $K_{max}$) and cavitation-resistance (low $\Psi_{50}$ or $\Psi_{88}$) is hypothesised although community-wide examples are rare [@Hacke:2006; @Gleason:2016]. We report such a trade-off at both leaf (*n* = 21 species) and branch level (*n* = 27 species). We also found that LMA~lamina~ and WSG~100^$\circ$^C~ were strong predictors of PLC curves for leaves, but not for xylem (not shown). Acquisitive traits such as high $K_{max}$ are expected to be associated with faster growth rates. We found a positive but not  significant relationship of adult growth rates ($\ge$ 10cm dbh) with $K_{max, ~leaf}$ (*R*^2^ = 0.13; *p* = 0.126, *n* = `leaf.traits.sp`) and no relationship with $K_{max, ~stem}$ (*n* = `stem.traits.sp` species). The relationships between ERD and aboveground hydraulic traits that we find will provide an important insight on how to model rooting depths and their coordination or trade-offs with other traits in order to better represent the functional diversity of tropical forests.

\
Our model estimated ERD as a single value, unlike the dynamic ERD modelled by @Chitra-Tarak.2018, but future model developments should investigate seasonal dynamics of ERD, using calibrated on corresponding calibration data on isotopic water sourcing depths. Our inverse ERD model was parametarised on 5-yearly growth data, with five data points over a 25-yr period, which decouples climate events and demographic outcomes. Future studies could better constrain the model with higher resolution growth data such as those from dendrometer bands. This is especially important for modeling seasonally dynamic ERD. However, trees' stem diameter change is a sum total of not just growth, the addition of wood, but also changes due to hydrostatic stem flexing, importance of which increases with temporal resolution [@Chitra-Tarak.2016; @Chitra-Tarak.2015]. Use of dendrometer data would thus entail accounting for stem hydrostatic flexing [@Zweifel:2018]. Two of our exploratory ERD models included seasonality in leaf area fraction, but we did not select them as they worsened the fit with growth data and evaluation data ($\delta^2H$, Fig. S\@ref(fig:other-erd-mods)). We interpret this result as that VPD and PLC curves may be adequate to explaine growth, but also acknowledge that our estimate of seasonality of leaf cover is a tentative estimate based on leaf fall data and assumption of leaf presence during the wet season and omits inter-annual variation. Future studies could make use of data from new technologies such as drone based monitoring of species-specific leaf area fraction in species-rich forests [@Park.2019]. In forests such as BCI where understory tree growth is more limited by availability of light rather than water, inversely estimating ERD for smaller tree size classes, especially from a few growth data points, may need accounting for variation in trees' light environment over time and among trees of the same size class, an issue we minimised by limiting ERD estimates to canopy trees. To estimate topographic variation in ERD within or across species future studies may use soil moisture dynamics from a distributed hydrological model [e.g. @Schwantes:2018]. We note that data availability on soil water retention curve ($\Psi_{soil}$ vs. VWC), hydraulic conductivity ($K_{soil}$) by depth, soil moisture by depth, stream discharge and evapotranspiration were important for effective calibration of our 1-D hydrological model, and recommend wide-spread data collection of these variables as well as water-table levels in forest-inventory sites to allow for estimation of trees' water environments. Finally, developing an inverse ERD model that accounts for movement of water within the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum (SPAC) would be a step change from the current statistical models of ERD (this study and @Chitra-Tarak.2018). Although data needs for parametarizing such models [@Christoffersen:2016kd2d; @Sperry.1998] could be greater (e.g. retention curves for roots), limiting immediate community-wide application, they promise to improve our understanding of plant physiology [e.g. see @Johnson:2018fad].
