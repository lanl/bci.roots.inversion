# Summary

- Among the mechanisms that plants employ to tolerate drought, deep water access is arguably the most commonly invoked, but under-studied. Vulnerability to embolism and hydraulic safety margins are shown to be predictors of drought-induced mortality risk, but deep-water access may delay plants from reaching critical safety thresholds. Here, we tested the role of deep-water access in enabling survival within a diverse tropical forest community (Panama) using a novel data-model approach. 
- We inversely modeled effective rooting depth (ERD, as the average depth of water extraction), for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` canopy species by linking growth dynamics (1990-2015) to vapor pressure deficit, water potentials in the whole-soil column, and to leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves. We validated ERD against existing tree and soil stable water isotope data. 
- Across species, deeper ERD was associated with higher stem hydraulic conductivity, greater vulnerability to xylem embolism, narrower safety margins, and lower mortality rates during extreme droughts. Species with deeper ERD spent less time below critical hydraulic thresholds indicating that trees compensate for water-stress related mortality risk through deeper water access.
- The role of deep-water access in alleviating mortality of hydraulically-vulnerable trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of forest dynamics under current and future climates.

# Introduction
\
Tropical forests play a disproportionately large role in the global carbon and energy cycles [@Bonan:2008], and support half of global biodiversity [@Wright:20050th], but face a threat from intensifying droughts [@Doughty:2015; @Xu.2019]. Tropical forests are logically considered to be an especially drought-vulnerable among biomes given the combination of climate risk and vegetation sensitivity [@Meir:2015trw], yet mortality events in the tropics are rarely as large as those in the temperate and boreal zones (@McDowell.2018), leading to questions regarding the role of large trait-diversity and hydraulic strategies in mitigating mortality events. Despite this, widespread drought-induced tree mortality has occurred across the tropics for specific functional groups [@Bennett:2015; @Chitra-Tarak.2018; @Hilker:2014; @Phillips:2010] and tropical mortality rates are increasing in some regions [@Brienen.2015; @Hubau.2020]. However, state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) struggle to capture drought-induced vegetation dynamics in the tropics [@Galbraith.2010; @Powell:2013; @Powell.2018], as underlying mechanisms of drought-tolerance are not fully understood or quantified.

\     Plants rely on a variety of structural and functional mechanisms to avoid or tolerate a drought, from adjustment of leaf area (deciduousness), change in leaf angle, reductions in stomatal conductance, upregulation of aquaporins, osmotic regulation to stem water storage, deep water access, increased root production, hydraulic redistribution and embolism resistance[@McDowell.2008]. Deep water access is arguably the most long-standing, yet under-studied mechanism. This mechanism assumes that plant available water varies with depth, and that the rooting depths of co-located trees also vary, by species and size [@Meinzer:1999; @Chitra-Tarak.2018; @Brum.2019]. Consequently, trees in the same forest may differ in their experience during a drought, and thus in their growth and mortality responses [@Chitra-Tarak.2018]. A key bottleneck in community-wide testing of this mechanism has been a lack of data in both trees' rooting or water-sourcing depths and plant available soil water at those depths. A recent meta-analysis documented maximum rooting depths for 318 tree species, that is, less than 0.5% of the world’s more than 60 thousand tree species [@Fan:2017; @Beech:2017]. Further, only a small fraction of those are tropical, even though more than 90% of the world’s tree diversity resides in the tropics [@Slik:2015]. Use of stable isotopes of water as a tracer provides an indirect measure of water sourcing depths by matching the isotopic value in xylem water to variations in soil pore water with depth. However, such data are rare [@Evaristo:2016] and their interpretation is an active area of research given unresolved issues pertaining to soil heterogeneity and the correspondence of soil water extract in the laboratory to actual plant available water [@Adams.2020; @Bowers.2020; @Deurwaerder.2020]. DNA barcoding of roots [@Jones.2011] may be used to to estimate species-specific rooting depths or rooting profiles, although extent of sampling required may be cost-prohibitive and DNA barcode libraries for tropical forests are still under development. In general, community-scale data collection for rooting or water-sourcing depths is challenging for species-rich tropical forests. 

\     Trade-offs in plant 'traits' shape how plants make a living in their environment leading to alternative ecological strategies. Characterizing the essential constraints necessary to model species-rich communities under a changing environment [@Koven:2020; @Christoffersen:2016kd2d; @Wright:2010; @Bartlett.2019] entails identifying the topography of trait trade-offs in different environments, and how these relate to demographic rates (growth, recruitment and mortality). Significant efforts have been invested into identifying and linking universal drought indices, above-ground traits, and demographic rates. These efforts have resulted in identification of correlations between aboveground hydraulic traits such as vulnerability to embolism and hydraulic safety margins and mortality [@Anderegg:2016], although numerous counter examples also exist [@Hoffmann.2011; @Johnson:2018fad; @Nardini:2015; @Paddock:2013, @Venturas.2016]. Deep roots may mitigate hydraulic vulnerability and mortality-risk, yet plants' realized water environments, specifically their ability to acquire water via differing rooting depths, are rarely studied, especially in the tropical region. We tested how rooting depth is linked to above-ground hydraulic traits and mortality for co-occurring tree species of a tropical forest over 35 years that witnessed droughts of various intensity and duration.
    
\     We used a locally parameterized and calibrated 1-D hydrological water balance model to obtain daily dynamics of soil water potential by depth in the whole-soil column and then applied a novel inverse model to estimate species effective rooting depths (ERD), defined as the depth at which soil water potential best explained observed dynamics of species-specific growth for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` dominant species (Fig. \@ref(fig:schematic)). This model incorporated the impact of atmospheric drought on growth and was constrained by above-ground hydraulic traits, namely, species-specific leaf vulnerability curves, by leveraging existing data for eight species and developing trait-based proxies for the rest. We evaluated ERD against existing dueterium to hydrogen content data for a subset of six tree species as an independent observation of ERD, given the corresponding gradient in isotopic composition of water in the soil profile. We tested coordination of ERD with hydraulic traits for a subset of eight species with both datasets. We finally analysed species' mortality rates across the censuses spanning 35 years to test whether ERD explained risk of drought-induced mortality in periods of extreme hydrological drought. Specifically, we tested an overarching hypothesis that inter-specific variation in trees' effective rooting depths (ERD) enables increasingly reliable water availability with depth and thus mitigation of hydraulic vulnerability. Our hypotheses are that (i) deep rooted trees have hydraulic traits associated with rapid water transport but cavitation-vulnerable xylem, whereas shallow rooted species are associated with less efficient but safer hydraulic traits (see Table \@ref(tab:hypo)); and that, (ii) deep rooted species have lower mortality rates due to low realized risk of hydraulic failure, whereas shallow rooted species may have higher mortality rates as a result of higher variability in water availability in shallow soil layers. To our knowledge this is the first study to test for a mechanistic link between plant available water in the whole-soil column, trees' above- and below-ground hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes for a species-rich forest.

# Materials and Methods
\
In the following sections we describe the study site, the models and data used to estimate and evaluate (1) soil water potential dynamics by depth in the whole-soil column and (2) species-specific effective rooting depths. These are followed by analyses to address the proposed hypotheses. Details of all datasets used are described in the Supplementary Information.

## Study site description
\
We conducted this study at the seasonally dry tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, given its extensive characterization in terms of long-term forest demography, plant functional ecology, hydrology, and data on stable water isotopes on tree species and soil from an independent study of tree water-sourcing depths [@Meinzer:1999]. The 1,560ha island was formed after the river Chagres was dammed in 1914 to create Gatun Lake and complete the Panama Canal. The entire island is forested and classified as a tropical moist forest in the Holdridge Life Zone system. Long-term hydrological monitoring at BCI began in 1972, while demographical monitoring began with the 50 ha ForestGEO plot establishment in 1981-82 [@Condit.1998uq; @Hubbell:1999; @Anderson-Teixeira:2014]. Rainfall at BCI is seasonal with a mean annual rainfall of `r round(rain.man.stats$rain)` mm ($\pm$ `r round(rain.man.stats$rain.sd)` SD; `r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`) and a four-month long dry season from mid-December through mid-April ($\le$ 100 mm rain month^-1^). Among the tree *species* found in the forest canopy, 28% are identified to be at least partly deciduous during the dry season, but this amounts to a maximum of 6.3% *trees* in the canopy that are deciduous, and the percentage of total forest crown area that is deciduous is estimated at 9.7% [@Condit:2000]. 

\     In the 50 ha plot all stems above 10 mm diameter at breast height (dbh) are mapped, tagged with a unique number, identified to species and measured every 5 years through 1985-2015 for growth, mortality as well as recruitment of new stems into the 10 mm dbh size class [@Condit.2017]. This inventory represents 321 woody species across the eight censuses. Aside from a 2ha patch of ~100-year-old secondary forest at the north-eastern corner of the plot the remaining 48ha represent old growth forest that was never clear cut for agriculture. The plot (1000 m $\times$ 500 m) was originally chosen for its relative uniformity of relief and other physical conditions; the elevation range is only 40 m (120-160 m) [@Harms:2001]. The plot is situated in the Conrad catchment. Soils of the plot are homogeneous with red light clays, described as the Ava soil type, accounting for 72.4% of the plot [@Baillie.2017]. The topsoil field texture is silty clay loam that gradually fines to silty clay in the subsoil. Soil is mostly free draining, but restricted subsoil permeability gives rise to temporary wet season ponding. Detailed descriptions of the climate, geology, flora and fauna of BCI can be found elsewhere [@Croat.1978; @Leigh.1982; @Gentry.1990].

## Model ELM-FATES for soil matric potentials

### Model description
\
To estimate dynamics of water availability by depth over the forest’s rooting zone, we used the Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model (ELM), coupled with the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) (hereafter, ELM-FATES). ELM is a land-model that, among many features, simulates the physics and conservative dynamics of water, energy and carbon fluxes. In particular, soil hydrologic fluxes are vertically resolved among discrete soil layers (1-D) [@Bonan:2013]. FATES is a community-based, open-source model used for studying climate-vegetation interactions. FATES is a vegetation demography model, with a size-structured group of plants (cohorts) and successional trajectory-based patches based on the ecosystem demography [@Moorcroft.2001] approach. FATES couples to ELM by a common interface of water and carbon fluxes. Detailed descriptions for ELM and FATES can be found elsewhere [@Fisher.2010; @Fisher.2015; @Koven:2020].

\     ELM-FATES parameterizes interception, throughfall, canopy drip, infiltration, evaporation, surface runoff, subsurface drainage, redistribution within the soil column, and groundwater discharge and recharge so as to simulate changes in canopy water $\Delta W$~can~, surface water $\Delta W$~sfc~, soil water $\Delta W$~liq,z~ at depth z and water in an unconfined aquifer $\Delta W_{a}$ (omitting processes relevant to snow, wetlands or lakes). Conservation of these terms is expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta W_{can} + \Delta W_{sfc} + \sum_{i=1}^{15} \Delta W_{liq,i} + \Delta W_{a} = \left(q_{rain} - E_{v} - E_{g} - q_{over} - q_{h2osfc} - q_{drai}\right)\Delta t
\end{split}
(\#eq:water-balance)
\end{equation}

where, $q$~rain~ is rainfall, $E_{v}$ is transpiration of the forest, $E_{g}$ is ground evaporation, $q$~over~ is surface runoff, $q$~h2osfc~ is runoff from surface water storage, $q$~drai~ is sub-surface drainage (all in mm H~2~O) and $\Delta t$ is the time-step (typically, 1 hour). The soil profile is discretized into 15 exponentially distributed soil layers with depth z, where z $\in$ Z, and Z = {0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.21, 0.37, 0.62, 1, 1.7, 2.9, 4.7, 7.8, 13, 21, 35} m.

### Model parameterization
\
To parameterize ELM-FATES, we identified eleven parameters relevant for Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), determined their ranges based on literature for the study site, when available, else for the tropics (Table \@ref(tab:param)), and ran 5000 simulations using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) of this global parameter space. In the Conrad catchment, existing data on soil hydraulic conductivity for the depths of 12.5 and 60 cm showed a decline of conductivity by depth (@Kinner:2004; Table \@ref(tab:param)). We generated 5000 LHS samples within the 95% CI for the two depths and assumed a linear decline between each paired sample, while for depths < 12.5 cm and > 60 cm, we assumed the same value as that for depths 12.5 and 60 cm, respectively (Fig. S\@ref(fig:ksat-profiles) [Need to fix SI Figs. numbering to begin at 1]). For greater accuracy, instead of the ELM default soil texture-based pedo-transfer functions, we estimated parameters of soil retention curves using existing data for gravimetric water content vs. $\Psi$~soil~ for depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m [@Kupers:2019]. We converted gravimetric water content to volumetric (VWC, $\theta$) using a bulk density value of of 0.8 g cm^-3^ measured at a point location (see below). A @Campbell.1974 empirical equation was fitted for all depths pooled together, as exploratory analyses indicated differences in water retention among depths were nominal,

\begin{equation}
\Psi_{soil} = \Psi_e\left(\frac{\theta}{\theta_{s}}\right)^{-b}
(\#eq:soil-ret-curve)
\end{equation}
where $\Psi_e$ is the air-entry matric potential, $\theta_{s}$ is the saturated volumetric water content, and $b$, an index for soil pore-size distribution, respectively. $\Psi_e$, $\theta_{s}$ and $b$ that best-fit the data were 200 (mm H~2~O), 0.51 (cm^3^ cm^-3^) and 10 (unitless), respectively.

\   We ran ELM-FATES for the 5000-member parameter ensemble with hourly climate drivers from 1985-2018 [@Faybishenko.2020] initialized with the observed stand structure from the 50 ha plot [@Condit.2019a] in a single site mode. As our key interest here was in deriving soil water availability, we ran ELM-FATES in a lower-complexity configuration: static stand structure, and with a single plant functional type (PFT) of evergreen trees. The latter was chosen as only 9.7% of BCI crown area is dry-season deciduous and addition of a dry-deciduous PFT did not significantly alter results (not shown). Holding the stand structure static rather than allowing it to emerge from physiologically-mediated competition between trees removes a set of internal model feedbacks and thus enables a cleaner experimental design where the only differences between model simulations are the direct physiological effects of perturbed model parameters. 

### Model calibration
\
We calibrated ELM-FATES over 2012-2018 against three key fluxes and states in Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance), namely, (i) evapotranspiration (ET) from the eddy flux tower (2012-2017; see [SI](#SIData.matteo)), comparable to $E_{v} + E_{g}$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:water-balance)), (ii) stream discharge $q_{run} from the Conrad catchment, comprabel to $q_{over} + q_{drai}$; 2012-2018; see [SI](#SIData.steveP)) and (iii) soil volumetric water content (VWC or $\theta_{z}) comparable to W_{liq, z}$) from two sources: a long-term (2012-2018) record of VWC from a point location near the eddy flux tower we obtained with a vertical TDR probe over 0-15 cm depth ($\theta_{0-0.15 m}$) and existing 50 ha plot-wide snap-shot measurements of VWC during the dry season of 2015 and 2016 for the depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m with 1299 samples in total covering all soil types and habitats (see [SI](#SIData.VWC) and @Kupers:2019 for details; hereafter, $\theta_{0.15 m}$, $\theta_{0.4 m}$ and $\theta_{1 m}$ refer to plot-wide averages).

For ELM-FATES calibration we calculated an objective function for each of the 5000-member ensemble by equally weighting standardized RMSE between observations and simulations across all fluxes and states. We describe the objective function $O$ as : 

<!-- # For html -->
<!-- \begin{align*} -->
<!-- \overline{O} = \frac{1}{6}\sum RMSE^{*}(ET,~E_{v} + E_{g}) + RMSE^{*}(q_{run},~q_{over} + q_{drai}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0-0.15m}, {W_{liq,~\overline{z}}})\\ -->
<!-- + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0.15m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[4]`m}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0.4~m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[6]`~m}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{1~m}, W_{liq,~`r soil.depths[8]`~m}) -->
<!-- (\#eq:obj-func) -->
<!-- \end{align*} -->

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\overline{O} = \frac{1}{6}\sum \left(RMSE^{*}(ET,E_{v} + E_{g}) + RMSE^{*}(q_{run},q_{over} + q_{drai}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0-0.15m}, {W_{liq,\overline{z}}}) \\
& + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0.15m}, W_{liq,`r soil.depths[4]`m}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{0.4~m}, W_{liq,`r soil.depths[6]`~m}) + RMSE^{*}(\theta_{1~m}, W_{liq,`r soil.depths[8]`~m})\right)
(\#eq:obj-func)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

based on monthly sums for both ET and $q$~run~ and daily averages for $\theta$s. $W$~liq,~$_{\overline{z}}$ is the average of daily $W$~liq,z~, where z $\in$ Z, and Z = {`r paste(soil.depths[1:4], collapse=", ")`} m. Superscript * indicates that RMSE is standardised between 0 and 1 across the 5000 simulations.

\   Preliminary analyses showed that minimising the objective function $\overline{O}$, that is, simultaneously fitting the model to all states and fluxes did not capture the soil moisture dynamics at 1 m depth well, our key priority for model calibration. To ensure model fit at 1 m depth, we first chose 300 parameter ensemble members that minimised RMSE between observations and simulations for VWC at the depth of 1 m ($RMSE^{*}(\theta_{1~m}, W_{liq,`r soil.depths[8]`~m}) < 0.2$), and among those 300 ensemble members we chose 100 members with the lowest values for the objective function $\overline{O}$. See Table \@ref(tab:param) for the ranges of best-fit values for different parameters. 

### Model evaluation
\
We evaluated ELM-FATES by calculating RMSE between simulated and observed long-term daily VWC for the depths of 0.1, 0.4 and 1 m (2016-2018), baesd on a dataset we had left-out during calibration. We obtained these observations from three horizontal time domain reflectometry probes at the depths of 0.1, 0.4 and 1 m at a point location near the eddy flux tower (see [SI](#SIData.VWC)).

## Hydrological droughts
\   We ran ELM-FATES with the chosen 100 ensemble members from 1985-2018, with the first 5 years used for model spin-up. Extreme soil droughts were identified by depth *z* as days that fell below the 5 percentile of mean $\Psi$~soil,*z*~ across all hydrological realisations values at that depth.

## Model for effective rooting depth (ERD)
\
To estimate effective rooting depth, we tested alternate models for growth (Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen) and those in SI), which use effective rooting depth as an input. There are many factors that could limit plant growth, including soil moisture, VPD, leaf area seasonality and radiation [@Lawrence.2019]. In this study, we used maximum diurnal leaf conductance (K~leaf~) approximated using rhizosphere soil water potential ($\Psi$~soil~) as a proxy for the soil water limiting factor on growth. In our models K~leaf~ therefore incorporates the effects of rooting depth and rhizosphere water potential. For each species', growth dynamics across census intervals was regressed against census interval means of multiplicative or additive effects of one or more factors calculated daily: VPD, K~leaf~ and the leaf area index (LAI), all standardized between 0 and 1. Based on our preliminary analyses, additional incorporation of radiation did not improve model fitting. At our study site, due to the coincidence of higher temperature, higher radiation, and lower humidity during the dry season, the impact of VPD may as well be a combined impact of not only temperature and humidity, but also radiation. 

\    For the chosen model (see Model validation and selection below), daily average growth for species $s$, $G_{s,t|z}$, in the census interval $t$ for depth $z$ and for a given hydrological realisation $h$ is described as follows:

\begin{equation}
G_{t|z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,i|z}^{*} VPD_{i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t|z}
(\#eq:M-chosen)
\end{equation}

where n~t~ be the total number of days in census interval *t*, the superscript * indicates that the variable has been standardized between 0 and 1, and $\epsilon$ is the model error term. See SI for equations for all the alternate models tested.

\    As VPD may have a non-linear relationship with growth, with growth increasing with VPD intially, but decreasing with VPD beyond an optimal value due to stomatal closure [AT:Chonggang, add a reference], we used a locally derived polynomial relationship between gross primary productivity (GPP) and VPD (see Model parametarisation) to represent the impact of VPD on growth and used GPP standardised between 0 and 1 (hereafter, VPD*) in Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen).

\    For each species, we estimated diurnal maximum value of K~leaf~$_{,s,i|z,h}$ for a species $s$ by substituting $\Psi$~soil~$_{,s,i|z,h}$ in the leaf vulnerability curves defined below in Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) using species-specific parameters $A_{s}$ and $B_{s}$ as:

\begin{equation}
K_{leaf,s,i|z,h} = A_{s}e^{-B_{s}\Psi_{soil,i|z,h}}
(\#eq:k-soil)
\end{equation}

\    By varying *z*, we estimated species effective rooting depths (ERD), defined as the depth *z* at which soil water dynamics ($\Psi$~soil,*z*~) best explained observed dynamics of species growth (six 5-yearly censuses, 1990-2015). Using Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen), for a species *s*, we obtained likelihood based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Pearson's correlation coefficient *r* for each soil depth *z* for each of the 100 best-fit hydrological realizations. For each hydrological realization *h* we retained only one depth that had the maximum likelihood (the minimum AIC score), and within those depths retained the ones that had Pearson's *r* >= 0.71 (or, *R*^2 >= 0.5) as a valid set. For a species *s*, we defined effective rooting depth (ERD) as the median of these set of the retained depths, which can be described as :

\begin{equation}
ERD_{s} = \underset{\forall \, h \, \in \, H}{median} \Big\{z,h\,\Big|\, \Big(Likelihood_{s|z,h} = \underset{\forall \, z \,\in\,Z}{maximum}(Likelihood_{s|~z,h})\Big) \cap \Big(r_{s|z,h} \ge 0.71\Big)\Big\}
(\#eq:erd)
\end{equation} 
where $H$ = {1, .., 100}, refer to the 100 hydrological realisations and $Z$ = {0.5, `r paste(soil.depths[8:length(soil.depths)], collapse=", ")`} m, covering the range of soil depths in ELM-FATES after above parametarision [AT:Chonggang, so that we can perform model evaluation, depths 0.21, 0.37 and 0.62 were all taken as if they were 0.5 m (not averaged).  How do I explain that? So hereafter 0.21, 0.37 and 0.62 were not retained, but only 0.5 m.].

### Model parameterization

#### Growth data
\
For growth estimates, to minimize the effect of light variation among trees, we selected only large trees ($\ge$30 cm dbh, the diameter at breast height) and also species whose maximum height was $\ge$30 m (hereafter, canopy species) and thus are likely to be fully exposed to the sun. We selected trees for which the height of the diameter measurements were unchanged across all censuses (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015). For each individual tree (*i*), we calculated absolute growth rates ($G_{i,t}$, cm yr^-1^) for each of the five census intervals ($t$) as the difference between tree dbh measured in successive censuses prorated by the inter-census interval based on the exact date of measurements. We eliminated positive outliers as any growth rates amounting to >75 mm yr^-1^, as this was the highest rate observed with confidence for fastest growing species [@Condit.2017]. Negative outliers were removed based on known measurement error, $\sigma_{e} = 0.006214d + 0.903$, where *d* is dbh. Any stem whose later dbh measurement fell <4$\sigma_{e}$ the earlier measurement was removed [@Condit.2017]. As tree growth rates vary with size [@Muller-Landau:2006], to keep growth rates comparable across census intervals, we obtained residuals from a dbh model of tree growth based on a tree's dbh at the beginning of a census interval ($Resid_{i,t} = G_{i,t} - f(d_{i,t})$). The diameter model of growth, $f(d_{i, t})$, a B-spline based polynomial equation with five degrees of freedom, was fitted to growth rates from all trees pooled together as there was insufficient species-specific data for large trees (Fig. S\@ref(fig:dbh-model)). We retained only those trees that had $Resid_{i,t}$ estimates for all census intervals (total trees = `r sum(g.n$n)`) and standardized (centered and scaled) individual tree time series of $Resid_{i,t}$. We then obtained `r length(erd.sp)` species-level time-series of medians of $Resid_{i,t}$ ($G_{t}$). These were obtained for only those species with complete records on at least three trees (median *n* = `r median(g.n$n)`, max *n* = `r max(g.n$n)` trees per species).

#### Leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves
\
We obtained leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves (K~leaf~ vs. $\Psi$~leaf~; see Table \@ref(tab:symbols) for trait symbols and their definitions) for adult trees of 21 common species from Zailaa et al. (to be submitted; see SI for brief description of methods) described as:

\begin{equation}
K_{leaf,s} = A_{s}e^{-B_{s}\Psi_{leaf_{s}}} + error
(\#eq:vc-exp)
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are fitted species-specific parameters. These 21 species included `r sp.n.data` of the `r length(erd.sp)` species selected for ERD estimation. For the rest `r sp.n.model` species, we obtained vulnerability curves using trait-based proxies. We identified scaling relationships between fitted parameters $A$ and $B$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:vc-exp) and two traits, namely, WSG, the wood specific gravity after drying at 100^$\circ$^C and LMA, the leaf mass per unit area measured for the leaf lamina excluding the petiole and for compound leaves the petiolules for leaves receiving direct sunlight (@Wright:2010; see SI for details). We fitted polynomial equations described as,

\begin{equation}
A_{s} = `r acf[1]` `r acf[2]`B_{s} `r acf[3]`B_{s}^2 + `r acf[4]`B_{s}LMA_{s} + `r acf[5]`LMA_{s} `r acf.6`LMA_{s}^2 + error
(\#eq:a-mod)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B_{s} = `r bcf[1]` `r bcf[2]`WSG_{s} + `r bcf[3]`WSG_{s}^2 + `r bcf[4]`WSG_{s}LMA_{s} + `r bcf[5]`LMA_{s} `r bcf[6]`LMA_{s}^2 + error
(\#eq:b-mod)
\end{equation}

\   As these fits explained a large proportion of variation in parameters $A$ and $B$ (see results), we sequentially used Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod) and \@ref(eq:a-mod) to predict parameters $B$ and $A$, respectively, for the `r sp.n.model` ERD species without direct data and estimated leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves using Eq. \#ref(eq:vc-exp). For all the 31 ERD species we estimated species $\Psi$~50,leaf~ based on their vulnerability curves (see Table \@ref(tab:symbols) for definition).

\   We obtained species-specific parameters $A$ & $B$ for Eq. \@ref(eq:k-soil) either from data when available, or a model based on LMA or WSG as described in the earlier section, and used K standardized between 0 and 1 within species (K*) in Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen).

Table \@ref(tab:symbols) here.

#### Leaf Area Index (LAI)
\
In the exploratory model for effective rooting depth, we explored the effect of seasonality in leaf area index (LAI, unitless) on growth. We assumed species-specific mean seasonal curves for LAI normalised between 0 and 1 (LAI, unitless), informed by a combination of long-term records for leaf-fall [@Wright.1990aeo] and leaf-lifetime [@Osnas.2018] (see SI). 

#### Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)
\
We fitted a polynomial curve between monthly average of mean midday values (11:00 to 15:00 hrs) of gross primary productivity (gC m^2^ day^-1^) we collected from the eddy flux tower located 75 m from the 50-ha plot (2012-2017) and VPD (kPa) calculated using the climate forcing data (for any day *i*, $GPP_i = `r vpd.cf[1]` + `r vpd.cf[2]`VPD_i + `r vpd.cf[3]`VPD_i^2 + error$; Fig. S\@ref(fig:gpp-vpd)); used VPD to predict GPP from 1990-2015, standardized it between 0 and 1, and used it as $VPD^*$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen)).

### Model validation and selection
\
To validate the ERD models we used data for xylem sap $\delta$^2^H (‰) as an independent observation of ERD. We used xylem sap $\delta$^2^H values given in @Meinzer:2001 for the dry-season of March 1997 as this period showed largest seasonal divergence among species, with a corresponding vertical gradient of $\delta$^2^H in the soil (Fig. S\@ref(fig:iso-data)). Briefly, this method makes use of a naturally formed gradient in deuterium to hydrogen ratio of soil water vertically belowground. Generally due to evaporative enrichment (here, during the dry season), shallow soil water has a greater deuterium to hydrogen content than deep water (here, $\delta$^2^H ranging from -16.5 to -50 ‰ over 0.05 to 1 m depth), with ground-water having the lowest deuterium to hydrogen content (here, -60 ‰), typically reflecting un-fractionated rain water. As root water-uptake is generally a non-fractionating process, $\delta$^2^H of water in the xylem sap of a tree reflects signature of the source water, and the tree's water-sourcing depth can therefore be identified as the soil depth with the same value of $\delta$^2^H as of the Xylem sap, or a mixture of shallower or deeper depths [@Dawson.1991]. Analyses of xylem sap $\delta$^2^H of the 12 species studied by @Meinzer:2001 showed that four species sourced water between 1 m and ground water. Two other had water access at least 0.8 m deep, one was restricted to water access between 0 to 0.2 m and five fell in the range over which the relationship between soil depth and soil water $\delta$^2^H was variable in the 0.2 to 0.7 m depth range. 

\   We compared six species with data for $\delta$^2^H as well as modelled estimates of ERD, after removing those species in @Meinzer:2001 that are likely to have no leaves in March 1997 because xylem sap $\delta$^2^H of these species may not be linked with water sourced at the time of measurement and thus may not be comparable with other species that had leaves. We also removed *Guapira standleyana*, whose xylem sap isotope value was not well constrained by the soil water isotope depth profile. For each model of ERD (Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen) and Eqs. in SI), estimated species ERD was regressed against species xylem sap $\delta$^2^H (‰).

## ERD coordination with above-ground hydraulic traits
\
To evaluate whether ERD was associated with above-ground hydraulic traits (*n* = 8 species with both datasets), we regressed species ERD against maximum stem hydraulic conductance (K~max,stem~), leaf turgor loss point ($\Psi$~tlp~), vulnerability to embolism from cavitation measured in terms of pressure at which 88% of stem hydraulic conductivity is lost ($\Psi$~88,stem~), and hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi$~min~ - $\Psi$~88,stem~). See [SI](#SIData.brett) for data collection and estimation of these variables.

## Mortality analyses and species-specific drought experience
\
We calculated mortality rates for large trees ($\ge$10 cm dbh) of species with ERD estimates (all canopy species with maximum height $\ge$30 m) and average abundance of at least 20 trees (one species with an average abundance of 9 trees was eliminated; *n* = `r length(erd.mrate.sp)`). For each of the seven census intervals ($t$) in the 35-yr record (1981-82, 1985, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2015), species $Mort_{t}$ (% yr^-1^) for two successive censuses (cen~1~ and cen~2~) was calculated as $Mort_{t} = \frac{D_{cen_{2}}}{N_{cen_{1}}}.\frac{100}{time}$, where $N$~cen~$_{_{1}}$ and $D$~cen~$_{_{1}}$ are the total number of trees of a species present in cen~1~ and dead in cen~2~, respectively, in the 50 ha plot and $time$ is the duration based on mean dates of cen~1~ and cen~2~. For each species we calculated mean mortality rate across all intervals as $Mort_{mean} = \frac{1}{6}\sum_{t=1}^{6} {Mort_{t}}$. 

\   We regressed species ERD against species (Mort~mean~). To assess whether deeper ERD species escape the experience of significant soil drought, we calculated for each speceis the proportion of days in the simulation period (1990-2015) during which soil water potential in the soil zone matching species ERD ($\Psi$~soil,z=ERD~) were below species $\Psi$~crit~. $\Psi$~crit~ was defined as $\Psi$~50,leaf~.

\
All statistical analyses were conducted in R statistical environment (version 3.5.3, @R:2019).

# Results
## Soil water dynamics by depth
\
The ELM-FATES simulations with the chosen best-fit parameter ensembles (Table \@ref(tab:param)) successfully captured the dynamics of soil moisture by depth (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib) A & Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)B), including the observations from the horizontal TDR probes that were not included in the calibration. These simulations also captured the dynamics in stream discharge (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)C) and to a moderate extent the dynamics in evapotranspiration (Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib)D). The reduction in parameter range in the best-fit ensembles compared to the global ranges tested showed that the above calibration was sensitive to the following parameters: the Ball-Berry stomatal slope parameter, the ELM rooting distribution parameter that regulates the depth of the rooting profile, soil hydraulic conductivity profile especially at depth, and our adjustment factor to soil hydraulic conductivity to account for macroporosity and direct flow paths (Table \@ref(tab:param)). 

Fig. \@ref(fig:hydro-calib) here.

\   Soil Water Potential dynamics ($\Psi$~soil,z~) by depth z (from 0.1 through 13 m) obtained from the best-fit simulations revealed that every 5-yr census interval had an extreme hydrological drought year, but census intervals varied in terms of number of such extreme years, drought intensity at depth, drought seasonality and duration (Fig. \@ref(fig:swp-droughts)). Notably, soil droughts in census intervals 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 distinctly occurred in the wet season, with one to two extreme soil drought years each, depending on depth location (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-droughts); Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-mort)). Across the simulation period (1990-2015) $\Psi$~soil,z~ remained above -0.5 MPa from depths 1.7 to 13 m (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-all-depths)).

Fig. \@ref(fig:swp-droughts) here.

## Leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves
\
For the leaf vulnerability curve parameters $A$ and $B$ fitted to the observed data for K~leaf~ vs. $\Psi$~leaf~, WSG and parameter $B$ explained a large proportion of variation in parameter $A$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:a-mod); *Adj. R*^2^ = `r afit.r2`; *p* `r  afit.p`; Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-fit)). WSG and LMA explained a large proportion of variation in parameter $B$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:b-mod); Adj. *R*^2^ = `r bfit.r2`; *p* `r  bfit.p`; also see Fig. S\@ref(fig:obs-plc-curves)). Vulnerability curve parameters were predicted for `r sp.n.model` out of `r length(erd.sp)` ERD species that lacked direct observations using Eqs. \@ref(eq:a-mod)-\@ref(eq:b-mod) (Table S\@ref(tab:ab-param), Fig.  S\@ref(fig:obs-comm-plc-curves)). 
Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-fit) here.

## Effective rooting depths (ERD)
\
ERD estimated from the chosen model with K~leaf~ and a multiplicative effect of VPD as explanatory variables (Eq. \@ref(eq:M2)) was strongly related to the measured isotopic signal ($\delta$^2^H), that is, with a high goodness-of-fit (*R*^2^ = 0.65; *p* = 0.027, *n* = `r length(unique(erd.iso$sp))`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-iso)). Two of the alternative models tested--with K~leaf~ and LAI, with or without an effect of VPD--had a strong relationship with $\delta$^2^H as well, but one that was based on a smaller set of species (*n* = 4) as fewer species passed the criteria of sufficient species-level goodness-of-fit; <20 vs. `r length(erd.sp)` species for the chosen model (Fig. S\@ref(fig:other-erd-mods)). For the rest of the analyses we therefore used ERD estimates from the less parimonious, chosen model (Eq. \@ref(eq:M-chosen)). 

Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-iso) here.

\   In this forest, modeled effective rooting depths (ERD) for the `r length(erd.sp)` large, canopy tree species varied from `r min(df.erd.to.plot$depth)` m to `r max(df.erd.to.plot$depth)` m (Fig. \@ref(fig:sp-erd)). Notably, two species, *L. seemannii* and *T. tuberculata*, that @Meinzer:1999 found to have xylem sap $\delta$^2^H values between soil water and groundwater, suggesting that these species sourced most of the water from depths >1 m, were also identified by our model with ERD >1 m (2.9 m for both species; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-iso)). 

Fig. \@ref(fig:sp-erd) here.

## Coordination of ERD with other hydraulic traits
\
For the subset of eight species with ERD for which hydraulic traits data were available, species with deeper ERD showed greater maximum stem hydraulic conductance (K~max,stem~, Spearmans' *r* = `r cor.k`, *p* = `r p.k`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)A), less negative leaf $\Psi$~tlp~ (Spearmans' *r* = `r cor.tlp`, *p* = `r p.tlp`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)B), less negative $\Psi$~88,stem~ and thus greater vulnerability to embolism from cavitation (Spearmans' *r* = `r cor.stem.88`, *p* = `r p.stem.88`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)C), and narrower hydraulic safety margins ($\Psi$~min~ - $\Psi$~88,stem~; Spearmans' *r* = `r cor.hsm`, *p* = `r p.hsm`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)D). 

Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd) here.

## Effective rooting depths, experienced drought and mortality
\
Species with deeper ERD had significantly lower mortality rates than deeper ERD species in the census intervals 1985-1990, 2000-2005 and 2005-2010. (*n* = `r nrow(mrate.depth.mean)`, Fig. S\@ref(fig:erd-mort-census)). These relationships were stronger among evergreen species ( *n* = `r nrow(mrate.depth.mean %>% subset(deciduous == "E"))`; Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-mort-census-evg)). Census intervals 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 were also the periods during which extreme soil droughts distinctly occurred in the wet season, effectively extending the dry season (Fig. \@ref(fig:swp-droughts)). Soil water availability was not modelled for 1985-1990. Analysis of a species' time spent under significant soil drought (proportion of days $\Psi$~soil,z=ERD~ < $\Psi$~crit~) showed that species with shallower ERD spent greater proportion of days below critical hydraulic thresholds (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-time); S\@ref(fig:erd-time-evg)). Species with ERD deeper than 1 m did not cross species $\Psi$~crit~ for the entire 25-yr period for which soil water potential $\Psi$~soil,z~ was modeled (1990-2015). Soil depths below 1 m remained above `r round(psi.1.7.min$median, 2)` MPa (`r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q97.5), 2)`, `r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q2.5), 2)`;  median, 95% CI) through all the dry seasons and drought periods, which is above ($\Psi$~crit~) of the most sensitive tree species (-0.28 MPa).

# Discussion
\
Our analyses revealed that co-occurring large canopy tree species with deeper effective rooting depths (ERD) were associated with higher hydraulic efficiency, but not safety (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-hyd)). Species with deeper ERD showed higher maximum stem hydraulic conductance, but greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower hydraulic safety margins compared to shallow ERD species. Nevertheless, deeper ERD species showed lower mortality rates than shallower ERD species over the 35-yr record (1981-2015) (Fig. S\@ref(fig:erd-mort-census), especially the evergreen species (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-mort-census-evg)). Analysis of time spent below ($\Psi$~crit~) in the soil zone matching ERD $\Psi$~soil,z=ERD~ showed that this was likely due to decreasing realized risk of hydraulic failure with increasing access to water for species with deeper ERD (Fig. \@ref(fig:erd-time); Fig. S\@ref(fig:erd-time-evg)). We thus demonstrate, for the first time, a link between realized drought experience, hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes for co-occurring adult tree species. 

### Realised drought risk integral to assessing drought-vulnerability
\
Our study brings attention to the need for assessing drought-sensitivity in terms of species realized drought risk by accounting for the actual hydrological drought and trees' deep water access, beyond the universal drought indices and trees' above-ground hydraulic vulnerability. We found that species accessing deeper water had greater xylem vulnerability to embolism and narrower branch hydraulic safety margins, that is, traits that are commonly identified as proxies for mortality risk, but they were less droughted and had lower mortality compared to species relying on shallower water through periods of significant droughts (Figs. \@ref(fig:erd-mort-census-evg),  S\@ref(fig:erd-mort-census), \@ref(fig:swp-droughts)). These results are consistent with a few studies that included three or four species each with known rooting or water sourcing depths and assessed their hydraulic traits and mortality rates during extreme droughts [@Johnson:2018fad; @Nardini:2015; @Venturas.2016]. @Johnson:2018fad found that mortality decreased with deep rooting even though deep rooted species were more vulnerable to xylem cavitation (high $\Psi$~88,stem~) and had narrower safety-margins ($\Psi$~min~ - $\Psi$~88,stem~). @Nardini:2015 found that a species sourcing deep water in a Karst system showed lower hydraulic failure and mortality in an extreme drought despite having high $\Psi$~88,stem~ and narrower safety margin compared to two species sourcing shallow-water.

\   Our result of lower mortality in deep rooted trees contrasts with the finding of @Chitra-Tarak.2018 in which species identified by their inverse ERD model as effectively deep rooted died *more* in a prolonged, extreme drought. Their hydrological model revealed that the multi-year drought exhausted the deep soil and even bedrock water availablity. In contrast, our hydrological modeling at BCI finds that despite higher frequency of droughts during our study period, $\Psi$~soil~ below 1 m remained above `r round(psi.1.7.min$median, 2)` (`r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q97.5), 2)`, `r round(as.numeric(psi.1.7.min$q2.5), 2)`; median, 95% CI) through all the dry seasons and droughts, that is above ($\Psi$~crit~) of the most sensitive tree species (-0.28 MPa). The difference in our results are likely attributable to site differences in the precipitation regime. In their dry forest site (Mudumalai National Park, India) precipitation is low: 1095 $\pm$ 296 mm (mean $\pm$ SD) compared to `r round(rain.man.stats$rain)` $\pm$ `r round(rain.man.stats$rain.sd)` mm (`r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`) at BCI, and precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratio at Mudumalai is nearly one (Penman-Monteith PET = 980 $\pm$ 64 mm), whereas at BCI it is nearly two (Penman-Monteith PET = `r round(mean(clim$pet.PM))` $\pm$ `r round(sd(clim$pet.PM))` mm;`r min(clim$Year)`-`r max(clim$Year)`; this study, @Guo.2016), and thus at BCI deep soil layers are effectively recharged annually (Fig. S\@ref(fig:swp-all-depths); @Chitra-Tarak.2018). And the kind of droughts that buffered the deep rooted species in our study were recurrent sub-annual droughts that extended the dry season into the wet season. The variation in mortality explained by ERD in our study is upto 40%; other causes may explain observed mortality [@McDowell.2018].

### Effective rooting depths at the tree community level
\
By estimating ERD for large trees of `r length(erd.sp)` canopy tree species, we make an important advance in modeling effective rooting depths at the community level in species-rich tropical forests. Our chosen ERD model is an advance over the only other inverse model of ERD (@Chitra-Tarak.2018; *n* = 12 species) as we employ a physiologically meaningful representation, fewer parameters and corroboration with tree and soil data for $\delta$^2^H. 

\   We benefited from finding a strong scaling relationship between commonly collected 'soft' traits at the community scale (LMA and WSG) and parameters of leaf vulnerability (or percent loss of conductance, (PLC)) curves for a few species (*n* = `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)`), a 'hard' trait. This allowed us to scale-up the leaf vulnerability curves at the community scale (*n* = `r length(ab.table$Species)` species, see Table S\@ref(tab:ab-param) for model predicted parameters). We find that leaf conductance declined more rapidly with declining $\Psi$~leaf~ for species with higher values of WSG and LMA (Fig. S\@ref(fig:obs-plc-curves)). Whether such scaling relationships between hard and soft traits hold true for other forests, and their wider applicability, remains to be seen as data on PLC curves are limited in tropical forests, but supportive and counter examples both exist [@McCulloh.2011; @Hoffmann.2011].

\   Another important piece of information for understanding effective rooting depth is stable water isotopes of xylem water and below-ground sources, in the vadose zone and water table. Although the interpretation of these data is still under research [@Deurwaerder.2020], they are critical for model calibration or validation. The model in @Chitra-Tarak.2018 were not corroborated with such data as existing methods were inadequate to extract water bound to the saprolite found in their dry forest study site (Jean Riotte, pers. comm.). The model of below-ground water-availability in this study (ELM-FATES) is far more advanced compared to that used by @Chitra-Tarak.2018 and was calibrated with data on long-term soil moisture dynamics at a point location (0-0.15m) and plot-wide measurements by depth (0.15, 0.4 and 1 m), as well as, evapotranspiration and stream discharge. @Chitra-Tarak.2018 was calibrated only on stream discharge and water table levels. We lacked data on water table levels which would have been useful to constrain water availability dynamics in the unobserved soil layers and the spatial variability within the plot. As in @Chitra-Tarak.2018, we also interpret our ERD estimates as revealing relative differences among species' effective rooting depths rather than in absolute terms.

### Future directions for model development
\
The trade-offs that we identify between above- and below-ground traits, the water environment vertically below-ground and mortality rates are important for representing diversity in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models especially in species-rich forests. The hydraulic efficiency-safety trade-off between high values of maximum stem conductivity (high K~max,stem~) and cavitation-resistance (low $\Psi$~50,stem~ or $\Psi$~88,stem~) is hypothesized although community-wide examples are rare [@Hacke:2006; @Gleason.2016]. We report such a trade-off (n = 26 species) at our study site stem level (). We also found that LMA and WSG were strong predictors of PLC curves for leaves, but not for stems (not shown). WSG alone explained `r round(a.wsg.r2*100,0)` % of variation in parameter $A$ ($A = `r a.wsg.cf[1]` `r a.wsg.cf[2]`B + `r a.wsg.cf[3]`B^2 + error$; *p* `r  a.wsg.p`) and `r round(b.wsg.r2*100,0)` % of variation in $B$ ($B = `r b.wsg.cf[1]` `r b.wsg.cf[2]`B + `r b.wsg.cf[3]`B^2 + error$; *p* `r  b.wsg.p`). Parameter $B$ alone explained `r round(a.b.r2*100,0)` % of variation in $A$ (*p* `r  a.b.p`), while LMA alone was weakly related to $A$ and was not related to $B$ (not shown). The relationships between ERD and above-ground hydraulic traits that we find will provide an important insight on how to model rooting depths and their coordination or trade-offs with other traits, including hydraulic vulnerability, in order to better represent the functional diversity of tropical forests, and their trajectories into the future.

\   Our model estimated ERD as a single value, unlike the dynamic ERD modeled by @Chitra-Tarak.2018, but future model developments should investigate seasonal dynamics of ERD, using corresponding calibration data on isotopically determined water-sourcing depths, as species are expected to shift to deeper soil water sources as shallow soils dry out [@Meinzer:1999]. Our inverse ERD model was parameterized on 5-year growth data, with five data points over a 25-yr period, which decouples climate events and demographic outcomes. Future studies could better constrain the model with higher resolution growth data such as those from dendrometer bands. This is especially important for modeling seasonally dynamic ERD. However, trees' stem diameter change is a sum total of not just growth, the addition of wood, but also changes due to hydrostatic stem flexing (xylem, phloem and bark hydration), the importance of which increases with temporal resolution [@Chitra-Tarak.2016; @Chitra-Tarak.2015]. Use of dendrometer data would thus entail accounting for stem hydrostatic flexing [@Zweifel:2018]. Three of our exploratory ERD models included seasonality in leaf area fraction, but we did not select them as they worsened the fit with growth data and evaluation data ($\delta$^2^H, Fig. S\@ref(fig:other-erd-mods)). We interpret this result as that VPD and PLC curves may be adequate to explain growth, but also acknowledge that our estimates of seasonality of LAI is a tentative estimate combining leaf fall data and assumption of leaf presence during the wet season, and omits inter-annual variation. Future studies could make use of data from new technologies such as drone based monitoring of species-specific leaf area fraction in species-rich tropical forests [@Park.2019]. In forests such as BCI where understory tree growth is more limited by availability of light rather than water, inversely estimating ERD for smaller tree size classes, especially from a few growth data points, may need accounting for variation in trees' light environment over time and among trees of the same size class, an issue we minimized by limiting ERD estimates to canopy trees. To estimate topographic variation in ERD within or across species future studies may use soil moisture dynamics from a distributed hydrological model [e.g. @Schwantes:2018]. We note that data availability on soil water retention curve ($\Psi$~soil~ vs. VWC), hydraulic conductivity (K~soil~) by depth, soil moisture by depth, stream discharge and evapotranspiration were important for effective calibration of our 1-D hydrological model. We recommend wide-spread data collection of these variables as well as water-table levels in forest-inventory sites to allow for estimation of trees' water environments. Finally, developing an inverse ERD model that accounts for movement of water within the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum (SPAC) would be a step change from the current statistical models of ERD (this study and @Chitra-Tarak.2018). Although data needs for parameterizing such models [@Christoffersen:2016kd2d; @Sperry.1998] could be greater (e.g. retention curves for roots), which limits immediate community-wide application, such models hold greater promise to improve our understanding of plant physiology [e.g. see @Johnson:2018fad].

# Conclusions

Establishing relationships between plant's environment, traits and demographic outcomes is imperative for developing a predictive plant ecology, but trees realized water environments and water-access are rarely studied. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a mechanistic link between trees' realized drought experience, above-ground hydraulic architecture and long-term mortality outcomes for a species-rich forest. The role of deep-water access that we find in alleviating mortality of drought-sensitive trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of tropical forest dynamics under current and future climate. Our community-scale framework for modeling effective rooting depths or leaf vulnerability curves indicate the possibilities in expanding the use of critical, hard-earned observations in species-rich forests towards community-scale generalizations.

## Data Descriptions 

### Microclimatic tower {#SIData.matteo}

The tower used for these measurements is 41 m above ground, on a plateau on BCI [@Pau.2018]. The eddy covariance system includes a sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) and an open-path infrared CO2/H2O gas analyzer (LI7500, LiCOR. Lincoln, NE). Hi-frequency (10Hz) measurements were acquired by a datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific) and stored on a local PC. Data were processed with a custom program using a standard routine described in [@Detto.2010]. QA/QC criteria for removing erroneous values are listed in table 1 (see below). GPP was derived from daytime values of NEE by adding the corresponding mean daily ecosystem respiration obtained as the intercept of the light response curve [@Lasslop.2010]. The light curve was fitted on a 15-days moving window using a rectangular hyperbolic function (runs with friction velocity less than 0.4 m s^-1^ were excluded). In order to compute daily time integrated budgets, gaps were filled using Artificial Neural Network [@Papale.2003] with hydro-meteorological inputs as predictors (soil moisture, solar radiation, temperature, VPD and air pressure, all measured on the same tower). To train the network, the dataset was randomly divided in a training set (70%), a validation set (15%) and a test set (15%). A two-layer feed-forward network with 10 sigmoid hidden neurons and linear output neurons, was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm until the mean square error (MSE) of the validation set stop improving [@Hagan.1994]. Performance, in term of MSE, was evaluated using the test set at the end of the training. This procedure was repeated 100 times to produce 100 estimates of GPP. Training multiple times generates different results due to different initial conditions and random sampling of the three sets. Ensemble was obtained as weighted average from the 100 ANN predictions using the MSE of the test set as weights according to:

$f_{i} = \frac{\sum_{k}f_{ik}^{ANN}/{MSE_{ik}}}{\sum_{k}1/{MSE_{ik}}}$

The ANN was implemented using the Neural Network Toolbox in Matlab 2014a. 

### Stream discharge from the Conrad catchment {#SIData.steveP}

The Conrad weir is located on the gently sloping western side of Barro Colorado Island. The weir consists of a 90 degree ‘V’ notch with a rectangular upper section. The weir was constructed in several stages between 1993 and 1996. Stream stage is recorded at 5-minute intervals.

The weir drains a catchment of approximately 40 ha of which at least 90% consists of the central plateau area of the island. Peak flow usually follows peak rain by approximately 2-3 hours. Large storms are sometimes preceded by small, initial peaks generated by the rain falling on the steeper slopes close to the weir.

Streamflow data are analyzed by software custom-built by author SP. The program is used to correct for blockages of the weir ‘V’ by fallen vegetation (a common occurrence), sensor drift, small gaps and other problems. Discharge is then calculated using an empirically derived rating curve calculated for each 1mm stream stage.

### Volumetric water content

We collected volumetric water content (VWC) data (2012-2018) from a point location at the eddy flux tower with a vertical time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe. The relationship between the output from the TDR probe and VWC was calibrated based on measurements of gravimetric water content (GWC) on several occasions from representative soils near the vertical probe (0-0.15 m) (Fig. S\@ref(fig:TDR-calib)). GWC was converted to VWC based on the observed mean bulk dry density of 0.8 g cm^-3^ near the TDR probe (*n* = 5, cylinder volume = 1250 cm^3^). Beginning in 2016 we additionally installed three horizontal probes at depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m and we applied the same calibration equation to these data (2016-2018) as that for the vertical probe. 

We also leveraged exisiting GWC measurements by @Kupers:2019 at the depths of 0.15, 0.4 and 1 m in summer 2015 (February, March and April) and 0.15, 0.4 in summer 2016 (March), with 1299 samples in total that covered all soil types and habitats in the plot. The sampling periods were 6, 5, 10 and 8 days long, respectively. The 2016 dry season was associated with the 2015–2016 El Niño (see @Kupers:2019 for further details). We converted these GWC measurements to VWC assuming a bulk density of 0.8 g cm^-3^. $\theta_{0.15 m}$, $\theta_{0.4 m}$ and $\theta_{1 m}$ refer to the plot-wide VWC averages by depth over each sampling period. Middle date of a sampling period is used for comparison with model simulations.

### Leaf Area Index

We generated an estimate of the mean seasonality curve for normalised leaf area index (LAI$^*$, range 0-1, unitless) for individual species as follows. We interpolated species-specific weekly leaf-fall data collected at two similar sites in BCI (1985-2020) to a daily estimate [@Wright.1990aeo]. We lead this daily leaf-fall time series by the species-specific average leaf-lifetime (in days) and used it as an estimate of the daily leaf-gain time-series. The difference between leaf-fall and leaf-gain gave an estimate of daily leaf-change time series, which was then scaled to express as a fraction of the total leaf fall in a given year. Beginning with the LAI$^*$ of 1 at the end of the wet season in the first year of the record, we acccumulated leaf-change over it to obtain a running estimate of the leaf-cover fraction, avaraged it by DOY across years and normalised it to obtain the species-specific seasonality curve in LAI$^*$ (range 0-1, unitless). (Fig. S\@ref(fig:leaf-cover)).

For five species, an estimate of leaf lifetime was available from direct observations [@Osnas.2018]. For the rest erd.sp.wo.ll species, leaf lifetime was predicted from LMA ($\overline{lifetime} = `r ll.lma.cf[1]` + `r ll.lma.cf[2]`LMA$; *R*^2^ = `r ll.lma.r2`; *p* `r ll.lma.p`, *n* = `r ll.lma.n`).

### Leaf hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation {#SIData.joseph}
\
The K~leaf~ was measured under steady state and high irradiance following the Evaporative Flux Method (FEM) [@Sack.2012] using a flowmeter. Briefly, the leaf was excised under filtered deionised water and attached to a water source (graduated cylinder) using clear plastic tubing. The system includes tubing of a known resistance, separated upstream and downstream by two sensors measuring the transpiration-driven water flow pressure in the EFM system [@Sack.2011]. The K~leaf~ is calculated as the ratio of the transpiration rate (E~leaf~; mmol s^-1^) to the difference in flow pressure (MPa) upstream and downstream from the resistance tubing, and further standardized to 25°C and by leaf area. At stability (CV < 5%), the leaf is left to equilibrate in plastic bags with moist paper towels and measured for $\Psi$~leaf~ using a Scholander pressure chamber. To construct vulnerability curves for each species, four different functions were fitted to species-specific K~leaf~ vs. $\Psi$~leaf~ data using the *anneal* optimization function in the R package likelihood: exponential without an intercept ($K_{leaf} = Ae^{-B\Psi_{leaf}}$), exponential with an intercept ($K_{leaf} = C + Ae^{-B\Psi_{leaf}}$), logistic ($K_{leaf} = \frac{A}{1 + \left(\frac{\Psi_{leaf}}{x_{0}}\right)^B}$) and sigmoidal ($K_{leaf} = \frac{A}{1 + e^{-\left(\frac{\Psi_{leaf} - x_{0}}{B}\right)}}$) [@Sack.2012]. The differences among AICc values for these functions were not large within species (see Zailaa et al. for more detailed methods description). We chose the exponential function without the intercept to fit observed data across species, and as a general function to scale-up to the community, because it had the lowest AICc for most species, captured the form of the observed data across all species well, and had the lowest number of parameters, that is, two.

### Stem maximum hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation {#SIData.brett}

Brett to edit.
\
Methods for Stem Maximum hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation closely followed [Christman.2012] and [Wolfe.2016]. Values for some of the species reported here were previously reported by @Dickman.2019 and @Wu.2020. The entire dataset and R script for the analyses are archived in the NGEE-Tropics archive (Wolfe 2020, To be done).

\   Canopy branches were cut from 4–10 trees of 26 species across three sites (Table SXX). The branch segments were enclosed in opaque plastic bags, and brought to the laboratory for measurements. Stem segments used for hydraulic conductivity (Kh) measurements were located at least 1 m from the cut end of the branch to minimize the number of open vessels that extended into the segment. Maximum vessel length was measured on a subset of samples from each species. Among species, maximum vessel length ranged XXX and length of stem between the cut that was made in the air to collect the branch and the section of stem used for Kh measurement was XXX (Table SXX).

\   Three leaves that were distal to the Kh segment were sealed in plastic bags and the entire branch was enclosed in black plastic bags for at least 30 minutes to stop transpiration. Just prior to measurement of Kh, leaf water potential of the three bagged leaves was measured with a pressure chamber. Since transpiration was stopped by bagging the leaves, leaf water potential was assumed to equal stem water potential (REFERENCE).

\   For each Kh segment, three measurements of stem water potential were made on stem sections that were located adjacent to the Kh segment. Stem sections that were approximately 40 mm in length were placed in nickel-plated aluminum chambers that were connected to Peltier-type psychrometers (Merrill Instruments, Logan, UT) and placed in a water bath at 30°C for 3 h to equilibrate the humidity within the cambers. Then water potential was measured using an automated multi-channel micro-voltmeter (CR7, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) with a 10 s thermocouple cooling current. For samples with water potential < -4 MPa, a 45 s cooling current was used to improve accuracy. Each psychrometer probe was calibrated against salt solutions beforehand and the plateau of the psychromatic response curve was used to assess water potential.

\   The Kh segments were removed from the branches by repeatedly cutting back the branch on both ends while it was submerged in water to relax the hydraulic tension within the xylem ((REFERENCE)). Then the ends were shaved clean with a fresh razor. Segments were 11–34 cm in length (mean ± SD = 22 ± 4 cm) and 0.2–1.6 cm in diameter (0.7 ± 0.2 cm). The segments were placed in a hydraulic conductivity apparatus similar to that described by Sperry et al. (1998) except that flow rate was measured with graduated pipettes instead of a balance. The perfusion solution was 10 mM KCl filtered to 0.2 m. For each segment, we measured the flow rate at three pressure heads: two that ranged 0.5–2 kPa and at zero pressure. Following Torres-Ruiz et al. (2012), Kh was calculated as the slope of the flow rate versus pressure gradient (i.e., pressure head divided by segment length) among the three pressure heads. Stem area specific hydraulic conductivity was (Ks) was calculated by dividing Kh by the cross-sectional area of stem. To calculate cross-sectional stem area, stem diameter was measured twice perpendicularly on both ends of the segment and averaged, then area was calculated assuming a circular cross section.

\   To assess vulnerability to cavitation, the branches were allowed to dry in the lab for 0 – 180 hours before they were measured for stem water potential and Ks. We used the water potential measured by the psychrometers because they are a more direct measurement. It has been noted that bagged-leaf water potential can deviate from stem water potential, especially when branch segments are relatively dry (REFERENCE). For some species, we noted this pattern while for others it was not apparent (Fig SXX). For each species, Ks was plotted against stem water potential and a Weibull curve was fit through the 90th  percentile of the points, following Wolfe et al. (2016)). The intercept of the curve was interpreted as maximum Ks and the water potential where the Weibull curve predicted 12, 50, 80, and 88 loss of maximum Ks were interpreted as P12, P50, P80, and P88, respectively.

### Data gaps in WSG and LMA {#SIData.rutuja}

Among the `r length(sp.exp.param$sp)` species with observed data on (K~leaf~ vs. $\Psi$~leaf~) used to build the community-level models of leaf vulnerability curves (Eqs. \@ref(eq:b-mod)-\@ref(eq:a-mod)), two lacked data on WSG and five on LMA~lamina~. We filled three gaps in LMA using predictions from a strong linear relationship between LMA and LMA~disc~, the latter defined as the mean leaf mass per unit area measured for a 1.483 cm^2^ leaf disc taken to avoid veins (g m^-2^) for leaves receiving direct sunlight ($\overline{LMA} = `r disc.cf[1]` + `r disc.cf[2]`LMA_{disc}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r disc.r2`; *p* `r disc.p`, *n* = `r disc.n`). We filled the two remaining gaps in LMA using predictions from a linear relationship between LMA and LMA~lamina~, as measured during the smaller, K~leaf~ campaign ($\overline{LMA} = `r lma.cf[1]` + `r lma.cf[2]`LMA_{lamina}$; Adj. *R*^2^ = `r lma.r2`; *p* `r lma.p`, *n* = `r lma.n`). We chose not to fill the two data gaps in WSG as available data were poor predictors of WSG.

## Alternative models for Effective Rooting Depth (ERD)

Below we present all the altervative models for Effective Rooting Depth (ERD). Daily average species-specific growth, $G_{t|z}$, in the census interval *t* given an ERD of depth *z*, is described as follows: 

\begin{equation}
G_{t|z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,i|z}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t|z}
(\#eq:M1)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t|z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,i|z}^{*} + VPD_{i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t|z}
(\#eq:M2)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t|z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,i|z}^{*} VPD_{i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t|z}
(\#eq:M3)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t|z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,i|z}^{*} LAI_{doy|i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t|z}
(\#eq:M4)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t|z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} (K^{*}_{leaf,i|z} + VPD^{*}_{i}) LAI^{*}_{doy|i}) + \epsilon_{t|z}
(\#eq:M5)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G_{t|z} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} K_{leaf,i|z}^{*}VPD_{i}^{*}LAI_{doy|i}^{*}) + \epsilon_{t|z}
(\#eq:M6)
\end{equation}
where n~t~ be the total number of days in census interval *t*, the superscript * indicates that the variable has been standardized between 0 and 1, and $\epsilon$ is a normally distributed model error term.
